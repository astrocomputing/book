**Chapter 16: Parameter Estimation: Likelihood Methods**

This chapter introduces one of the most fundamental and widely applied frameworks for **parameter estimation** in astrophysics and across the sciences: **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**. Building upon the concepts of probability distributions from the previous chapter, MLE provides a principled approach for determining the "best-fit" parameters of a model given a set of observed data. We begin by rigorously defining the central concept of the **likelihood function**, explaining how it quantifies the probability of observing the actual data under different model parameter assumptions and highlighting the convenience of working with the log-likelihood. We then introduce the core principle of MLE – finding the parameter values that maximize this likelihood function – and illustrate it with simple analytical examples, revealing its connection to familiar methods like least-squares fitting for Gaussian errors. Recognizing that analytical solutions are often impossible for complex models, we delve into practical numerical optimization techniques using Python's `SciPy` library (specifically `scipy.optimize.minimize`) to find the MLE parameters. Crucially, estimating the uncertainty associated with these best-fit parameters is essential, so we explore common methods, including using the curvature of the likelihood function near its maximum (via the Hessian matrix often provided by optimizers) and the conceptually powerful but computationally intensive bootstrapping technique. The related idea of using profile likelihoods to construct confidence intervals is also introduced. Finally, a practical example fitting a power-law model demonstrates the complete workflow from defining the likelihood to finding parameters and estimating their uncertainties using MLE.

**16.1 The Likelihood Function: Connecting Data and Models**

The cornerstone of both maximum likelihood estimation and Bayesian inference (Chapter 17) is the **likelihood function**. It provides the crucial link between a proposed theoretical model (characterized by a set of parameters, θ) and the actual data (D) that has been observed. Formally, the likelihood function, L(θ | D), is defined as the probability (for discrete data) or probability density (for continuous data) of obtaining the observed data D, *viewed as a function of the model parameters θ*, assuming the model itself is true. This distinction is critical: while the mathematical formula for the likelihood might be identical to that of the probability distribution of the data given the parameters, P(D | θ), the *interpretation* changes. In probability, θ is fixed and D varies; in likelihood, the observed data D is fixed, and we explore how likely different parameter values θ are in light of that fixed data.

The construction of the likelihood function relies fundamentally on having a probabilistic model that describes the data generation process, including both the underlying physical model and the nature of the measurement uncertainties or random fluctuations. Let p(dᵢ | θ) be the probability or probability density function for observing a single data point dᵢ, given the model parameters θ. If we assume that our dataset D consists of `n` **independent** measurements, {d₁, d₂, ..., d<0xE2><0x82><0x99>}, a standard and often justifiable assumption in many experimental settings, then the likelihood of observing the entire dataset is simply the product of the probabilities (or densities) for each individual, independent measurement:

L(θ | D) = p(d₁ | θ) * p(d₂ | θ) * ... * p(d<0xE2><0x82><0x99> | θ) = Π<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2><0xE1><0xB5><0x83>₁<0xE1><0xB5><0x83>ⁿ p(d<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2> | θ)

This product form arises directly from the definition of independence: the probability of multiple independent events occurring together is the product of their individual probabilities. The likelihood function, therefore, quantifies the collective probability assigned by the model (with parameters θ) to the specific set of data points we actually observed. Parameter values that make the observed data appear more probable under the model will yield higher likelihood values.

Consider again the simple Poisson counting experiment from Chapter 13, where we observe `k` photons in time Δt from a source with an unknown true average rate λ (our parameter θ=λ). The probability of observing `k` counts is given by the Poisson PMF: p(k | λ) = [(λΔt)^k * exp(-λΔt)] / k!. The likelihood function for λ, given the observation `k`, is L(λ | k) = [(λΔt)^k * exp(-λΔt)] / k!. If we made `n` independent measurements and observed counts {k₁, k₂, ..., k<0xE2><0x82><0x99>} in intervals Δt₁, Δt₂, ..., Δt<0xE2><0x82><0x99> (where Δt<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2> could be the same or different), the total likelihood would be the product: L(λ | {k<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2>}) = Π<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2> [(λΔt<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2>)^k<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2> * exp(-λΔt<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2>)] / k<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2>!. This function evaluates the likelihood of different intrinsic rates λ given the entire set of observed counts.

Similarly, revisit the continuous example of measuring a source flux F₀ (our parameter θ=F₀) `n` times, {F₁, ..., F<0xE2><0x82><0x99>}, where each measurement has independent Gaussian noise with a known standard deviation σ. The probability density for a single measurement Fᵢ is given by the Gaussian PDF: p(Fᵢ | F₀, σ) = [1 / (σ * sqrt(2π))] * exp[-(Fᵢ - F₀)² / (2σ²)]. The likelihood function for the parameter F₀, given the dataset {F<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2>} and known σ, is the product of these PDFs:

L(F₀ | {F<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2>}, σ) = Π<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2><0xE1><0xB5><0x83>₁<0xE1><0xB5><0x83>ⁿ [1 / (σ * sqrt(2π))] * exp[-(F<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2> - F₀)² / (2σ²)]

This function L(F₀ | ...) assigns a relative likelihood to each possible value of the true flux F₀ based on how well that value predicts the observed scatter of measurements {F<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2>}, given the known measurement uncertainty σ.

Calculating the likelihood often involves multiplying many small probability values, which can lead to numerical underflow (resulting in zero) on a computer, especially for large datasets. To circumvent this and often simplify the mathematics, it is standard practice to work with the **natural logarithm of the likelihood function**, known as the **log-likelihood**, denoted ln L(θ | D) or ℓ(θ | D). Since the logarithm is a monotonically increasing function, the parameter value θ that maximizes L(θ | D) will also maximize ln L(θ | D). Using the logarithm conveniently transforms the product of probabilities into a sum of log-probabilities:

ln L(θ | D) = Σ<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2><0xE1><0xB5><0x83>₁<0xE1><0xB5><0x83>ⁿ ln[ p(d<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2> | θ) ]

This sum is numerically much more stable and often easier to differentiate when seeking the maximum analytically or numerically. For the Gaussian flux example, the log-likelihood becomes:

ln L(F₀ | {F<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2>}, σ) = Σ<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2><0xE1><0xB5><0x83>₁<0xE1><0xB5><0x83>ⁿ [ -ln(σ * sqrt(2π)) - (F<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2> - F₀)² / (2σ²) ]
= - (n/2) * ln(2πσ²) - (1 / 2) * Σ<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2><0xE1><0xB5><0x83>₁<0xE1><0xB5><0x83>ⁿ [(F<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2> - F₀)² / σ²]

Notice the second term is directly related to the **Chi-squared (χ²)** statistic used in least-squares fitting: χ² = Σ [(Observed - Model)² / Uncertainty²]. Specifically, ln L = -0.5 * χ² + constant (where the constant depends on `n` and σ but not the parameter F₀). Therefore, maximizing the Gaussian log-likelihood is mathematically equivalent to minimizing the χ² statistic. This establishes the fundamental connection between likelihood methods and the widely used method of least squares when dealing with data where uncertainties can be reasonably approximated as Gaussian.

Constructing the correct likelihood function is the most critical step in applying likelihood-based inference. It requires carefully considering:
1.  The underlying physical model and its parameters θ.
2.  The nature of the data: Is it discrete counts (suggesting Poisson likelihood) or continuous measurements (suggesting Gaussian, or perhaps other continuous distributions like Cauchy or Student's t if outliers are expected)?
3.  The nature of the uncertainties: Are they known for each data point (σ<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2>)? Are they constant? Do they depend on the signal itself (e.g., Poisson noise where variance ≈ mean)? Is the error distribution truly Gaussian?
4.  Assumptions about independence: Are the data points truly independent measurements? If not, correlations need to be incorporated, typically by using multivariate probability distributions and covariance matrices.

Once defined, the likelihood function L(θ | D) encapsulates all the information the data D provides about the parameters θ, within the context of the assumed model. It serves as the engine for estimating parameters (MLE, next section) and forms a core component of Bayesian inference (Chapter 17), where it is combined with prior information to determine the full posterior probability distribution of the parameters. Defining and calculating the likelihood (or log-likelihood) accurately is therefore paramount.

**16.2 Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**

The principle of **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)** provides a well-defined and statistically motivated method for finding the "best" estimate of model parameters θ given observed data D. Based on the likelihood function L(θ | D) introduced in the previous section, which quantifies how probable the observed data is under different parameter values, MLE simply states that the best estimate for θ is the set of values that *maximizes* this likelihood function. In other words, the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE), denoted θ̂<0xE1><0xB5><0x82><0xE1><0xB5><0x87><0xE1><0xB5><0x8A>, is the parameter value that makes the observed data seem "most likely" or "most probable" according to the assumed model.

Mathematically, we seek the value θ̂<0xE1><0xB5><0x82><0xE1><0xB5><0x87><0xE1><0xB5><0x8A> such that:
θ̂<0xE1><0xB5><0x82><0xE1><0xB5><0x87><0xE1><0xB5><0x8A> = arg max<0xE1><0xB5><0x89> [ L(θ | D) ]
where "arg max" means finding the argument θ that yields the maximum function value. As discussed previously, maximizing the likelihood L is equivalent to maximizing the **log-likelihood** ln L (or minimizing the negative log-likelihood -ln L), which is usually preferred for numerical stability and mathematical convenience:
θ̂<0xE1><0xB5><0x82><0xE1><0xB5><0x87><0xE1><0xB5><0x8A> = arg max<0xE1><0xB5><0x89> [ ln L(θ | D) ] = arg min<0xE1><0xB5><0x89> [ -ln L(θ | D) ]

In certain simple scenarios, the MLE can be determined analytically. This typically involves taking the partial derivatives of the log-likelihood function with respect to each parameter θ<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2> in the set θ, setting these derivatives to zero (∂(ln L)/∂θ<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2> = 0), and solving the resulting system of equations for the parameters. We saw two examples in Section 16.1:
*   For estimating the mean F₀ of `n` Gaussian measurements {F<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2>} with known equal variance σ², the MLE F₀<0xE1><0xB5><0x82><0xE1><0xB5><0x87><0xE1><0xB5><0x8A> is the sample mean F̄ = (1/n) ΣF<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2>.
*   If the variances σ<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2> differ, the MLE F₀<0xE1><0xB5><0x82><0xE1><0xB5><0x87><0xE1><0xB5><0x8A> is the inverse-variance weighted mean.
*   For estimating the rate λ from a single Poisson count `k` observed in time Δt, the MLE λ̂ is k / Δt.
These analytical results often align with intuitive estimators, lending credence to the MLE principle.

However, for the majority of realistic astrophysical models, which may involve multiple parameters interacting non-linearly, finding an analytical solution for the MLE is usually impossible. The system of equations obtained by setting the derivatives of the log-likelihood to zero is often too complex to solve algebraically. In these prevalent cases, we must resort to **numerical optimization** techniques (covered in Section 16.3) to find the parameter values that maximize the log-likelihood function computationally.

Maximum Likelihood Estimation is a cornerstone of frequentist statistical inference due to its desirable properties, particularly in the limit of large sample sizes (asymptotic properties). Under general mathematical regularity conditions on the likelihood function, MLEs possess the following key characteristics as the number of data points `n` approaches infinity:
*   **Consistency:** The MLE θ̂<0xE1><0xB5><0x82><0xE1><0xB5><0x87><0xE1><0xB5><0x8A> converges in probability to the true underlying parameter value θ₀. This means that with enough data, the MLE will get arbitrarily close to the true value.
*   **Asymptotic Unbiasedness:** The expected value (average over many hypothetical datasets) of the MLE approaches the true value as `n` increases (E[θ̂<0xE1><0xB5><0x82><0xE1><0xB5><0x87><0xE1><0xB5><0x8A>] → θ₀). It's important to note that MLEs can sometimes exhibit bias for small sample sizes `n`.
*   **Asymptotic Efficiency:** The variance of the MLE achieves the theoretical minimum possible variance for any unbiased estimator, known as the Cramér-Rao lower bound. This implies that, for large samples, the MLE makes the most efficient use of the available data to constrain the parameters; no other unbiased estimator can achieve a smaller variance (higher precision).
*   **Asymptotic Normality:** The sampling distribution of the MLE θ̂<0xE1><0xB5><0x82><0xE1><0xB5><0x87><0xE1><0xB5><0x8A> around the true value θ₀ approaches a multivariate Gaussian distribution as `n` increases. The covariance matrix of this Gaussian distribution is related to the inverse of the Fisher Information Matrix (or the negative Hessian of the log-likelihood), providing a basis for estimating uncertainties (Sec 16.4).

These strong theoretical properties make MLE a very appealing and widely adopted method for parameter estimation in many scientific disciplines, including astrophysics, especially given the large datasets often available. It provides a statistically principled way to identify the parameter values that best explain the observed data within the framework of a chosen model and likelihood function.

However, the validity and optimality of the MLE depend critically on the **correctness of the assumed model and likelihood function**. If the model is misspecified (i.e., it doesn't accurately represent the underlying physical process) or if the likelihood function doesn't correctly describe the data's error distribution (e.g., assuming Gaussian errors when the data has significant non-Gaussian outliers or systematic effects), the resulting MLE may be biased, inefficient, or scientifically misleading, regardless of its mathematical optimality *under the assumed model*. Robustness checks, model diagnostics, and considering alternative models or likelihood functions are therefore essential parts of a careful analysis.

Furthermore, the MLE provides only a **point estimate** – a single set of "best-fit" parameter values. It does not, in itself, convey the uncertainty associated with this estimate. While the asymptotic normality property allows us to estimate standard errors based on the likelihood function's curvature near the peak (Sec 16.4), this is an approximation valid for large samples. Characterizing the full uncertainty, especially for small samples or complex likelihood surfaces, often requires examining the shape of the entire likelihood function (e.g., via profile likelihood, Sec 16.5) or adopting a Bayesian approach (Chapter 17) which yields the complete posterior probability distribution.

Despite these considerations, MLE serves as a fundamental and powerful tool. Its connection to minimizing Chi-squared for Gaussian errors makes it implicitly used in many standard fitting routines. Understanding the principle of maximizing likelihood provides a unifying framework for parameter estimation across diverse data types and error distributions, moving beyond ad-hoc fitting methods towards statistically grounded inference. The practical challenge, addressed next, lies in numerically finding this maximum likelihood solution for complex astrophysical models.

**16.3 Finding the Maximum: Optimization Techniques**

For the majority of scientifically interesting models in astrophysics, the log-likelihood function, ln L(θ | D), is a complex, non-linear function of multiple parameters θ, making an analytical solution for the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) impossible. In these common scenarios, we must turn to **numerical optimization** (also known as numerical maximization or minimization) algorithms to computationally find the parameter values θ̂<0xE1><0xB5><0x82><0xE1><0xB5><0x87><0xE1><0xB5><0x8A> that maximize ln L(θ | D). Since optimization routines are typically designed to find *minima* rather than maxima, the standard practice is to find the MLE by **minimizing the negative log-likelihood function**, -ln L(θ | D). The widely used `scipy.optimize` module in Python's SciPy library provides a powerful and versatile suite of algorithms for performing such minimizations.

Numerical optimization algorithms are iterative procedures designed to find the minimum (or maximum) of a given objective function (in our case, -ln L). They typically require the user to provide:
1.  The **objective function** itself, implemented as a Python function that takes the parameter vector θ as input and returns the scalar value -ln L. This function usually also needs access to the observed data D.
2.  An **initial guess** or starting point (θ₀) for the parameters in the parameter space.
3.  Optionally, **bounds** or constraints on the allowed parameter values (e.g., requiring a parameter representing a standard deviation or a mass to be positive).
4.  Optionally, functions that compute the **gradient** (first derivatives) and/or the **Hessian** (second derivatives) of the objective function with respect to the parameters. Providing analytical derivatives, if feasible, can significantly speed up convergence and improve accuracy for gradient-based methods, although many algorithms can estimate them numerically if not provided.

The optimization algorithm then starts at θ₀ and iteratively updates the parameter values, moving "downhill" on the objective function surface until it converges to a point where the function value is locally minimized (ideally the global minimum, which corresponds to the MLE). The specific path taken and the convergence properties depend on the chosen algorithm.

`scipy.optimize` offers access to numerous algorithms via the convenient `scipy.optimize.minimize()` function. You select the desired algorithm using the `method` argument. Common choices relevant for MLE include:
*   **Gradient-Based Methods:**
    *   `'BFGS'` (Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno): A quasi-Newton method that approximates the Hessian matrix using gradient information. Often efficient for smooth, unconstrained problems.
    *   `'L-BFGS-B'`: A limited-memory version of BFGS, suitable for problems with a larger number of parameters as it uses less memory to store the Hessian approximation. Crucially, it also supports **box bounds** on parameters (e.g., `param >= 0`). Often a good default choice.
    *   `'CG'` (Conjugate Gradient): Another iterative method using gradient information, can be effective for large-scale problems but might be slower or less robust than BFGS variants.
    *   `'Newton-CG'`: Uses a Newton-CG algorithm, requires the gradient and potentially the Hessian (or an approximation). Can converge quickly near the minimum if the Hessian is well-behaved.
*   **Derivative-Free Methods:**
    *   `'Nelder-Mead'` (Simplex algorithm): A popular method that doesn't require derivatives. It works by evaluating the function at the vertices of a simplex (a geometric figure) and iteratively moving/resizing the simplex towards the minimum. It can be robust to noisy functions but may converge slowly and doesn't easily handle bounds.
    *   `'Powell'`: Another derivative-free method using conjugate directions.

The `minimize()` function is called as `result = minimize(objective_func, initial_guess, args=(data,), method='...', bounds=...)`. The `args` tuple contains any additional arguments (like the observed data) needed by your `objective_func` besides the parameter vector. The `bounds` argument (a sequence of `(min, max)` pairs for each parameter, using `None` for no bound) is used by methods like 'L-BFGS-B'.

The function returns an `OptimizeResult` object (`result`) which contains crucial information about the outcome. `result.success` (boolean) indicates if the optimizer thinks it converged successfully. `result.message` provides a description of the termination status. The optimal parameters found are in `result.x` (this is our MLE estimate θ̂<0xE1><0xB5><0x82><0xE1><0xB5><0x87><0xE1><0xB5><0x8A>). `result.fun` gives the minimum value of the objective function (-ln L) achieved. Some methods (like 'BFGS') also return an estimate of the inverse Hessian matrix in `result.hess_inv`, which is valuable for estimating parameter uncertainties (Sec 16.4).

Choosing a good initial guess (θ₀) can be critical for successful convergence, especially if the likelihood surface has multiple local minima or flat regions. Using physically motivated values, estimates from simpler methods (like method of moments or least squares), or results from a preliminary grid search can provide good starting points. Running the optimization from multiple different starting points is a common strategy to increase confidence that the global minimum (the true MLE) has been found, rather than just a local one.

It's also important to check the `result.success` flag and `result.message`. A `False` success flag indicates the algorithm terminated before converging reliably (e.g., maximum iterations reached, gradient norm too large), and the returned parameters in `result.x` may not be the true minimum. Investigating the cause (e.g., poor initial guess, issues with function/gradient calculation, inappropriate algorithm choice) is necessary in such cases.

Numerical optimization using tools like `scipy.optimize.minimize` provides the essential computational engine for finding Maximum Likelihood Estimates for complex astrophysical models. By defining the negative log-likelihood function based on a statistical model of the data and its errors, these algorithms allow us to find the parameter values that best explain the observations according to the likelihood principle, forming a cornerstone of modern statistical model fitting.

**16.4 Estimating Uncertainties on Parameters (Fisher Information, Bootstrap)**

The Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) procedure yields a single point estimate (θ̂<0xE1><0xB5><0x82><0xE1><0xB5><0x87><0xE1><0xB5><0x8A>) for the model parameters, representing the values that best fit the data under the likelihood framework. However, this point estimate alone is insufficient; we need to quantify the **uncertainty** associated with it. How precisely have our data constrained the parameters? If we were to repeat the experiment, how much would our estimated parameters likely fluctuate? This section explores common frequentist methods for estimating the uncertainties (standard errors or confidence intervals) on MLE parameters.

A widely used approach, particularly valid in the **large sample limit**, relies on the theoretical connection between the likelihood function's shape near its maximum and the uncertainty of the MLE. According to asymptotic likelihood theory, as the number of data points `n` increases, the distribution of the MLE θ̂<0xE1><0xB5><0x82><0xE1><0xB5><0x87><0xE1><0xB5><0x8A> around the true value θ₀ approaches a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The covariance matrix of this Gaussian distribution, which quantifies the variances of the parameters and the covariances between them, is given by the inverse of the **Fisher Information Matrix**, I(θ₀)⁻¹.

The Fisher Information Matrix I(θ) measures the amount of information the data provides about the parameters θ. It can be defined as the negative expectation of the Hessian matrix (the matrix of second partial derivatives) of the log-likelihood function: I(θ)<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2><0xE1><0xB5><0x97> = -E[ ∂²(ln L) / (∂θ<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2> ∂θ<0xE2><0x82><0x97>) ]. For large `n`, the covariance matrix of the MLE is approximately Cov(θ̂) ≈ [ I(θ̂) ]⁻¹ ≈ [ -H(θ̂) ]⁻¹, where H(θ̂) is the Hessian matrix of the log-likelihood evaluated *at the MLE*.

This theoretical result provides a practical way to estimate uncertainties. If we can compute or approximate the Hessian matrix H of the log-likelihood function at the MLE θ̂<0xE1><0xB5><0x82><0xE1><0xB5><0x87><0xE1><0xB5><0x8A>, then the inverse of the negative Hessian, [-H(θ̂)]⁻¹, gives an estimate of the covariance matrix for the MLE parameters. The diagonal elements of this estimated covariance matrix represent the variances (σ<0xE1><0xB5><0x82>²) of the individual parameter estimates, and their square roots yield the approximate **standard errors** (σ<0xE1><0xB5><0x82>) for the MLE parameters.

Many numerical optimization algorithms used to find the MLE, particularly quasi-Newton methods like 'BFGS' available in `scipy.optimize.minimize`, compute an approximation to the inverse Hessian matrix as part of their optimization process. This is often accessible via the returned `OptimizeResult` object, typically as `result.hess_inv`. If the objective function minimized was the *negative* log-likelihood (-ln L), then its Hessian is -H(ln L). The inverse of this Hessian, `result.hess_inv` ≈ [-H(ln L)]⁻¹, directly approximates the desired covariance matrix Cov(θ̂). Thus, after a successful optimization using a method like 'BFGS':
1.  Retrieve `result.hess_inv`. Ensure it's valid (e.g., positive definite).
2.  Extract the diagonal elements: `variances = np.diag(result.hess_inv)`.
3.  Calculate standard errors: `std_errors = np.sqrt(variances)` (ensure variances > 0).
These `std_errors` are the estimated ±1σ uncertainties commonly reported alongside MLE parameters.

*(Code Example 1 from previous section 16.4 already demonstrates extracting uncertainties from a simulated `hess_inv` object, showing steps 2-4. Note again that L-BFGS-B often doesn't return `hess_inv` directly, requiring methods like BFGS or numerical differentiation)*

The off-diagonal elements of the estimated covariance matrix [-H(θ̂)]⁻¹ quantify the **covariance** between pairs of parameter estimates. A non-zero covariance indicates that the uncertainties in those parameters are correlated. For example, if fitting a line `y = mx + c`, the estimates for the slope `m` and intercept `c` are often anti-correlated (if you increase the slope, you often need to decrease the intercept to maintain a good fit). These correlations are important for understanding the full uncertainty landscape and are often visualized using confidence ellipses or, in Bayesian analysis, using corner plots (Chapter 17). The correlation coefficient between two parameters θ<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2> and θ<0xE2><0x82><0x97> can be calculated from the covariance matrix C as ρ<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2><0xE1><0xB5><0x97> = C<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2><0xE1><0xB5><0x97> / sqrt(C<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2><0xE1><0xB5><0xA2> * C<0xE2><0x82><0x97><0xE2><0x82><0x97>).

This Hessian-based method for estimating uncertainties is computationally convenient as the necessary matrix is often a by-product of the optimization process. However, it relies on the **asymptotic normality** of the MLE and the assumption that the log-likelihood surface is well-approximated by a quadratic function (making the Hessian constant) near the maximum. These assumptions may break down for small sample sizes, highly non-linear models, parameters near boundaries, or complex likelihood surfaces. In such cases, the standard errors derived from the Hessian might be inaccurate.

An alternative, non-parametric, and often more robust approach for estimating uncertainties, especially when the asymptotic assumptions are questionable, is **bootstrapping**. Bootstrapping treats the observed dataset itself as the best representation of the underlying population distribution and simulates drawing new datasets from it to see how the estimated parameters vary. The standard non-parametric bootstrap procedure is:
1.  From the original dataset D containing `n` data points, create a "bootstrap sample" D* by drawing `n` points *with replacement* from D. Each bootstrap sample will have the same size `n` but will typically contain duplicate points from D and omit others.
2.  Perform the *exact same* MLE analysis procedure on the bootstrap sample D* to obtain a bootstrap estimate of the parameters, θ̂*.
3.  Repeat steps 1 and 2 a large number of times (B, e.g., B=500, 1000, or more) to generate a collection of bootstrap parameter estimates {θ̂*₁, θ̂*₂, ..., θ̂*<0xE2><0x82><0x8B>}.
4.  The distribution of these B bootstrap estimates {θ̂*<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2>} provides information about the uncertainty of the original MLE θ̂<0xE1><0xB5><0x82><0xE1><0xB5><0x8A>. The standard deviation of the bootstrap estimates serves as an estimate of the standard error of θ̂<0xE1><0xB5><0x82><0xE1><0xB5><0x8A>. Percentiles of the bootstrap distribution (e.g., the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles) can be used to construct approximate 95% confidence intervals for the true parameter value (the "percentile interval"). More sophisticated bootstrap confidence interval methods also exist (like BCa).

# Explanation: This code outlines the non-parametric bootstrap procedure.
# 1. It assumes an initial successful MLE fit (`result`, `mle_params_orig`).
# 2. It loops `n_bootstraps` times.
# 3. Inside the loop:
#    a. It creates a `bootstrap_data` sample by randomly choosing indices *with replacement* 
#       from the original `data`.
#    b. It performs the *same* MLE optimization (`minimize`) using this `bootstrap_data` 
#       (starting the optimization near the original MLE often helps speed).
#    c. If the bootstrap fit succeeds, the resulting parameters are stored. Error handling 
#       for failed bootstrap fits is important.
# 4. After the loop, it analyzes the distribution of the collected `bootstrap_params`:
#    a. The standard deviation of the bootstrap `mu` values (`std_err_boot_mu`) provides 
#       an estimate of the standard error for the original `mu_mle`. Similarly for `sigma`.
#    b. The 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the bootstrap `mu` distribution provide 
#       an approximate 95% confidence interval for `mu`. Similarly for `sigma`.
# This demonstrates how resampling the data provides an empirical estimate of parameter 
# uncertainty without relying on the Hessian approximation. Note the increased computational cost.
```

Bootstrapping makes fewer assumptions than Hessian-based methods (primarily that the sample is representative of the population and errors are independent). It can capture asymmetry in the uncertainty distribution reflected in the percentile intervals. However, it requires the MLE procedure to be run many times, making it computationally expensive, especially if the optimization itself is slow. `astropy.stats.bootstrap` can simplify generating the bootstrap indices or data samples.

In practice, both Hessian-based standard errors and bootstrapping are valuable tools. Hessian methods are quick and often sufficient for large samples and well-behaved problems. Bootstrapping provides a more robust check, especially if asymptotic assumptions are questionable, at the cost of computation time. Comparing results from both methods can increase confidence in the estimated uncertainties.

**16.5 Profile Likelihood**

While standard errors derived from the Hessian matrix (Sec 16.4) provide a convenient estimate of parameter uncertainties based on a Gaussian approximation of the likelihood function near its peak, this approximation can be inaccurate when the likelihood surface is non-quadratic (e.g., asymmetric or has boundaries) or when parameters are significantly correlated. Bootstrapping offers a non-parametric alternative but can be computationally expensive. **Profile likelihood** provides another method within the frequentist framework to derive potentially more accurate **confidence intervals** by directly exploring the shape of the likelihood function itself, rather than relying solely on its curvature at the maximum.

The core idea is to determine the plausible range for a single parameter of interest (say, θ₁) while properly accounting for the uncertainty contributed by optimizing all other "nuisance" parameters (θ₂, θ₃, ...) in the model. The **profile likelihood function** for θ₁, denoted L<0xE1><0xB5><0x96>(θ₁), is defined as the maximum value the full likelihood function L(θ₁, θ₂, θ₃, ...) can achieve when θ₁ is held *fixed* at a specific value, while all other parameters (θ₂, θ₃, ...) are allowed to adjust to maximize the likelihood for that fixed θ₁.

L<0xE1><0xB5><0x96>(θ₁) = max<0xE2><0x82><0x99>₂, <0xE1><0xB5><0x89>₃, ... [ L(θ₁, θ₂, θ₃, ...) ]

Calculating this requires performing a constrained optimization for each value of θ₁ we want to evaluate. We scan θ₁ across a range of interest around its MLE value (θ̂₁), and for each `mu_fixed` in the scan, we run an optimizer (like `scipy.optimize.minimize` on the negative log-likelihood) varying only θ₂, θ₃, ... to find the best possible likelihood achievable with θ₁ fixed. Plotting the resulting maximum log-likelihood (-minimum negative log-likelihood) against the fixed θ₁ values traces out the profile log-likelihood curve, ln L<0xE1><0xB5><0x96>(θ₁). This profile represents the "ridgeline" of the full likelihood surface projected onto the θ₁ axis.

The significance of the profile likelihood stems from **Wilks' Theorem**. This theorem states that, under certain regularity conditions and for large sample sizes, the **likelihood ratio test statistic**, often defined as λ(θ₁) = -2 * [ ln L<0xE1><0xB5><0x96>(θ₁) - ln L(θ̂) ], approximately follows a **Chi-squared (χ²) distribution with 1 degree of freedom** (since we fixed one parameter, θ₁). Here, ln L(θ̂) is the maximum value of the log-likelihood achieved by the overall MLE θ̂ = (θ̂₁, θ̂₂, ...). The statistic λ(θ₁) measures how significantly the log-likelihood drops when θ₁ is fixed away from its MLE value, after allowing all other parameters to readjust optimally.

This connection to the χ² distribution allows us to construct confidence intervals for θ₁. A (1 - α) confidence interval for θ₁ consists of all values θ₁ for which the observed data is "not too unlikely" compared to the best fit. Specifically, it includes all θ₁ values such that the profile log-likelihood ln L<0xE1><0xB5><0x96>(θ₁) is within a certain threshold below the maximum log-likelihood ln L(θ̂). The threshold is determined by the critical value of the χ² distribution with 1 degree of freedom (χ²₁,α). Common thresholds for Δ(ln L) = ln L(θ̂) - ln L<0xE1><0xB5><0x96>(θ₁) are:
*   Δ(ln L) = 0.5 (corresponding to λ=1.0, the χ²₁,₀.₃₁₇ critical value) yields the ≈ 68.3% confidence interval (analogous to ±1σ for Gaussian likelihood).
*   Δ(ln L) = 2.0 (corresponding to λ=4.0, the χ²₁,₀.₀₄₆ critical value) yields the ≈ 95.4% confidence interval (analogous to ±2σ).
*   Δ(ln L) = 4.5 (corresponding to λ=9.0, the χ²₁,₀.₀₀₃ critical value) yields the ≈ 99.7% confidence interval (analogous to ±3σ).
*   For the conventional 95% confidence interval (α=0.05), the χ²₁,₀.₀₅ critical value is ≈ 3.84, so Δ(ln L) ≈ 1.92.

To find the confidence interval boundaries, we first find the overall MLE θ̂ and the maximum log-likelihood ln L(θ̂). Then, we calculate the profile log-likelihood ln L<0xE1><0xB5><0x96>(θ₁) over a range of θ₁ values around θ̂₁. Finally, we find the values of θ₁ where the profile curve ln L<0xE1><0xB5><0x96>(θ₁) intersects the threshold line ln L(θ̂) - Δ(ln L) (e.g., ln L(θ̂) - 0.5 for 1σ equivalent). These intersection points define the lower and upper bounds of the profile likelihood confidence interval. This might require numerical root-finding or interpolation on the calculated profile likelihood curve.

*(Code Example 1 from previous section 16.5 already demonstrates the conceptual calculation and plotting of a profile likelihood, showing the scan over `mu`, the re-optimization of `sigma`, and plotting the resulting profile relative to thresholds like ΔlnL = -0.5 and -2.0)*

The primary advantage of profile likelihood intervals is that they naturally account for correlations between parameters and non-quadratic shapes (like asymmetry or boundaries) in the likelihood function, often providing more accurate confidence intervals than those derived from the Hessian approximation, especially for smaller datasets or more complex models. They rely only on the likelihood function itself and Wilks' theorem (an asymptotic result, but often works reasonably well).

The main disadvantage is computational cost. Calculating the profile requires performing potentially many numerical optimizations (one for each point scanned in the parameter of interest). For models with many parameters, profiling each parameter individually can become very time-consuming. Techniques exist to optimize profile calculation, but it remains significantly more intensive than simply inverting the Hessian matrix.

Profile likelihoods are also valuable for visualizing the constraints on individual parameters, revealing asymmetries or flat directions in the likelihood surface that might be missed by standard errors alone. They form an important tool in the frequentist approach to uncertainty quantification, offering a potentially more accurate alternative to Hessian-based errors when computational resources permit or when non-Gaussian likelihood shapes are suspected. They are also closely related to the likelihood ratio test used for hypothesis testing and model comparison (Chapter 18).

**16.6 Example: Fitting a Power-Law to Data**

Power-law relationships abound in astrophysics, describing phenomena as diverse as the initial mass function of stars, the luminosity function of active galactic nuclei, the energy spectra of cosmic rays, the size distribution of dust grains, and the frequency of solar flares. A common task is therefore to fit a power-law model to observed data points and determine the model parameters, particularly the **power-law index** (or slope in log-log space) and the **normalization**. This section provides a practical example using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to fit a simple power law `y = A * x<0xE1><0xB5><0xAE>` to data `(xᵢ, yᵢ)` with associated Gaussian uncertainties `σᵢ` on the `yᵢ` values.

The model has two parameters: the normalization constant `A` and the power-law index `β`. Our goal is to find the MLE values (Â, β̂) that best describe the data {xᵢ, yᵢ, σᵢ}. Assuming the uncertainties σ<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2> are Gaussian and independent, maximizing the likelihood is equivalent to minimizing the **Chi-squared (χ²)** statistic, which measures the weighted sum of squared residuals between the data and the model:

χ²(A, β) = Σ<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2> [ (y<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2> - y<0xE1><0xB5><0x9B><0xE1><0xB5><0x92><0xE1><0xB5><0x87><0xE1><0xB5><0x86>ᵢ(A, β))² / σ<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2>² ]
where the model prediction is y<0xE1><0xB5><0x9B><0xE1><0xB5><0x92><0xE1><0xB5><0x87><0xE1><0xB5><0x86>ᵢ(A, β) = A * x<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2><0xE1><0xB5><0xAE>.
Our task is thus to find the values of A and β that minimize this χ² sum. This is equivalent to maximizing the Gaussian log-likelihood function: ln L ∝ -0.5 * χ².

Since the model `A * x<0xE1><0xB5><0xAE>` is non-linear in the parameter β, we cannot solve for the minimum χ² analytically in general. We must use numerical optimization. We will define a Python function that calculates χ² given the parameters `[A, beta]` and the data arrays `x`, `y`, `y_err`. Then, we will use `scipy.optimize.minimize` to find the parameter values that minimize this function.

A common alternative approach often seen in practice is to **linearize** the model by taking logarithms: log(y) = log(A) + β * log(x). If we define Y = log(y), X = log(x), and C = log(A), the model becomes Y = C + β * X, which is a simple linear equation relating Y and X. One could then perform a linear least-squares fit in log-log space to find C and β. This is computationally simpler and often works well for visualization as power laws appear as straight lines on log-log plots. However, this linearization fundamentally changes the assumed error distribution. Standard linear least squares assumes constant Gaussian errors on *Y* (log(y)), which is generally *not* equivalent to assuming constant Gaussian errors or constant *relative* errors on the original `y` values. Fitting in log-log space implicitly gives more weight to data points with smaller `y` values compared to fitting the non-linear model in linear space with appropriate weighting by σ<0xE1><0xB5><0xA2>². Unless the uncertainties truly warrant a logarithmic transformation, directly minimizing the χ² for the non-linear model in linear space (as we do here) is generally statistically preferable, though potentially more computationally demanding.

Our implementation will involve:
1.  Simulating some data `(xᵢ, yᵢ, σᵢ)` that roughly follows a power law `y = A * x<0xE1><0xB5><0xAE>`.
2.  Defining a Python function `power_law_model(x, A, beta)`.
3.  Defining a Python function `chi_squared(params, x, y, y_err)` that takes `params=[A, beta]` and the data arrays, calculates the model prediction, and returns the χ² value.
4.  Providing reasonable initial guesses for `A` and `beta`.
5.  Calling `scipy.optimize.minimize(chi_squared, initial_guess, args=(x_data, y_observed, y_error), ...)` to find the MLE parameters `[A_mle, beta_mle]`.
6.  Estimating uncertainties on A_mle and beta_mle, likely using the inverse Hessian approximation (Sec 16.4) by re-running with a suitable optimizer method like 'BFGS' if needed.
7.  Plotting the data with error bars and the best-fit power-law model on a log-log scale.

This workflow exemplifies applying MLE via χ² minimization to fit a common non-linear astrophysical model, providing both best-fit parameters and their uncertainties. Care must be taken with initial guesses and potential bounds (e.g., A > 0 might be a physical requirement).

**Application 16.A: Fitting a Quasar Emission Line Profile (Gaussian)**

**Objective:** This application demonstrates fitting a simple spectral model (a Gaussian profile representing an emission line plus a constant continuum) to a segment of astrophysical spectra using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), assuming Gaussian errors on the flux measurements. It reinforces defining a model, constructing a likelihood function (equivalent to minimizing Chi-squared), using `scipy.optimize.minimize`, and estimating parameter uncertainties from the Hessian matrix (Sec 16.1-16.4).

**Astrophysical Context:** Quasar and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) spectra often exhibit broad and/or narrow emission lines superimposed on a continuum. Measuring the properties of these lines – their central wavelength (which gives redshift), width (related to gas kinematics or temperature), and flux (related to luminosity) – is crucial for understanding the physical conditions near the central supermassive black hole and the kinematics of the emitting gas (e.g., in the Broad Line Region or Narrow Line Region). A common first approximation for modeling the shape of an individual emission line is a Gaussian function.

**Data Source:** A segment of a 1D astronomical spectrum, provided as arrays of wavelength (`wav`), flux (`flux`), and flux error (`flux_err`). This could be extracted from a FITS spectrum file (e.g., from SDSS, see Chapter 10) or simulated data covering a specific emission line (e.g., H-alpha, Mg II, C IV). We will simulate data containing a Gaussian line plus continuum and noise.

**Modules Used:** `numpy` (for arrays and calculations), `scipy.optimize.minimize` (for MLE optimization), `scipy.stats.norm` (implicitly used via Chi-squared), `matplotlib.pyplot` (for plotting).

**Technique Focus:** Defining a Python function for the model (`gaussian_plus_continuum`). Defining the objective function to minimize – the Chi-squared statistic `χ² = Σ [(fluxᵢ - modelᵢ)² / flux_errᵢ²]`, which corresponds to maximizing the Gaussian log-likelihood. Providing reasonable initial guesses for the model parameters (continuum level, line amplitude, center, width). Using `minimize` to find the MLE parameters. Estimating parameter uncertainties from the approximate covariance matrix derived from the inverse Hessian returned by the optimizer (e.g., using 'BFGS' method). Visualizing the data and the best-fit model.

**Processing Step 1: Load/Simulate Data:** Obtain or simulate arrays `wav`, `flux`, `flux_err` covering an emission line region. Ensure `flux_err` represents 1-sigma Gaussian uncertainties.

**Processing Step 2: Define Model and Objective Function:**
    *   Create `model(wav, params)` where `params = [continuum, amplitude, center, width]`. Inside, calculate `continuum + amplitude * exp(-(wav - center)² / (2 * width²))`.
    *   Create `chi_squared(params, wav, flux, flux_err)` which calculates `model(wav, params)` and returns `np.sum(((flux - model) / flux_err)**2)`. Include checks for invalid parameters (e.g., `width <= 0`, `amplitude < 0` if emission expected).

**Processing Step 3: Initial Guess and Optimization:** Estimate initial guesses for parameters based on visual inspection of the data or prior knowledge (e.g., median flux for continuum, peak height for amplitude, wavelength of peak for center, visual estimate for width). Provide these guesses to `minimize(chi_squared, initial_guess, args=(wav, flux, flux_err), method='BFGS')`. (BFGS is often good and provides Hessian info). Check `result.success`.

**Processing Step 4: Extract Results and Uncertainties:** If successful, get MLE parameters from `result.x`. Calculate approximate uncertainties from `result.hess_inv` as described in Sec 16.4 (Cov ≈ 2 * hess_inv for Chi2 minimization; variances are diagonal elements, std errors are sqrt(variances)). Report parameters ± standard errors.

**Processing Step 5: Visualization:** Plot the observed spectrum (`flux` vs `wav`) with error bars (`plt.errorbar`). Overplot the best-fit model (`model(wav_smooth, mle_params)`) using a smooth wavelength array `wav_smooth`. Optionally, also plot the individual Gaussian and continuum components. Add title and labels.

**Output, Testing, and Extension:** Output includes the MLE parameter values (continuum, amplitude, center, width) with their estimated standard errors, the minimum Chi-squared value, and the plot showing the data and fit. **Testing:** Verify the fit visually. Check if parameter values and uncertainties are physically reasonable. Compare the minimum Chi-squared value to the degrees of freedom (`len(data) - num_params`) to assess goodness-of-fit qualitatively (χ²/dof ≈ 1 is good). **Extensions:** (1) Fit a different line profile (e.g., Lorentzian or Voigt) by changing the model function. (2) Fit multiple Gaussian components if the line profile is complex or blended. (3) Use profile likelihood (Sec 16.5) or bootstrapping (Sec 16.4) to get potentially more robust confidence intervals, especially if parameters are strongly correlated. (4) Incorporate parameter bounds explicitly using `minimize` options (e.g., width > 0). (5) Use `astropy.modeling` which provides built-in models (like `Gaussian1D`, `Const1D`) and fitting routines that often wrap `scipy.optimize`.

**Application 16.B: Fitting Asteroid Thermal Model (Planck Function)**

**Objective:** This application demonstrates fitting a physical model based on fundamental constants – the Planck function for thermal emission – to multi-wavelength infrared photometric data from an asteroid using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (minimizing Chi-squared). It involves defining a model incorporating `astropy.units` and `astropy.constants`, optimizing parameters (like temperature and effective radius/normalization), and estimating uncertainties. Reinforces Sec 16.1-16.4, 3.3-3.5.

**Astrophysical Context:** Asteroids absorb sunlight and re-radiate it thermally, primarily in the infrared. Measuring the emitted thermal flux at different infrared wavelengths allows astronomers to estimate the asteroid's size, albedo (reflectivity), and surface temperature properties. A simple model often used is the Standard Thermal Model (STM) or related variants, which approximate the asteroid as a sphere with a certain temperature distribution, emitting according to the Planck function. Fitting this model to observed infrared fluxes (e.g., from WISE, Spitzer, NEOWISE) allows deriving these physical parameters.

**Data Source:** A set of infrared flux density measurements (`flux`, `flux_err`) for a single asteroid observed at several distinct wavelengths (`wavelengths`). This data might come from querying IRSA for WISE or Spitzer photometry. We will simulate this data.

**Modules Used:** `numpy`, `scipy.optimize.minimize`, `astropy.units` as u, `astropy.constants` as const, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `astropy.modeling.physical_models` (optional, contains `BlackBody` model).

**Technique Focus:** Defining a physical model function (`planck_model`) incorporating `astropy.constants` (h, c, k_B) and handling units via `astropy.units`. Defining the Chi-squared objective function using the model and data (flux, error, wavelength). Using `minimize` to find the MLE for model parameters (e.g., Temperature `T` and a normalization factor related to size/distance/emissivity `Norm`). Estimating uncertainties from the Hessian approximation. Plotting the data and the best-fit Planck spectrum.

**Processing Step 1: Load/Simulate Data:** Obtain or simulate arrays `wavelengths` (e.g., WISE bands: 3.4, 4.6, 12, 22 microns, with units), `fluxes` (e.g., in Jy, with units), and `flux_errors` (in Jy, with units).

**Processing Step 2: Define Model and Objective Function:**
    *   Define `planck_B_lambda(wav, T)` using `const.h`, `const.c`, `const.k_B` and the Planck's law formula for spectral radiance Bλ(T) = (2hc²/λ⁵) / (exp(hc/(λkT)) - 1). Ensure input `wav` and `T` are Quantities and the output has correct units (e.g., W / m³ / sr or convertible). Astropy's `BlackBody` model can also be used here.
    *   Define the observed flux model, e.g., `flux_model(wav, T, Norm) = Norm * planck_B_lambda(wav, T)`. `Norm` incorporates factors like solid angle (related to radius²/distance²) and emissivity (assumed constant here). Parameters are `params=[T, Norm]`.
    *   Define `chi_squared_planck(params, wav_data, flux_data, flux_err_data)`. Inside, calculate `flux_model`. Ensure all quantities have compatible units before calculating residuals (e.g., convert model to Jy). Return `np.sum(((flux_data - flux_model) / flux_err_data)**2)`. Add checks for `T <= 0` or `Norm <= 0`.

**Processing Step 3: Initial Guess and Optimization:** Estimate initial guesses for `T` (e.g., typical asteroid temperature ~200-300 K) and `Norm` (based on observed flux levels). Provide bounds (T>0, Norm>0). Call `minimize(chi_squared_planck, initial_guess, args=(...), method='L-BFGS-B', bounds=...)`. Check `result.success`.

**Processing Step 4: Extract Results and Uncertainties:** Get MLE `T_mle`, `Norm_mle` from `result.x`. Calculate uncertainties from `result.hess_inv` (approx Cov ≈ 2 * hess_inv for Chi2 min), getting σ<0xE1><0xB5><0x8B> and σ<0xE1><0xB5><0x8A><0xE1><0xB5><0x92><0xE1><0xB5><0xA3><0xE1><0xB5><0x8B>. Report results T ± σ<0xE1><0xB5><0x8B>, Norm ± σ<0xE1><0xB5><0x8A><0xE1><0xB5><0x92><0xE1><0xB5><0xA3><0xE1><0xB5><0x8B>. If `Norm` relates to radius R (Norm ≈ π(R/D)² where D is distance), derive R and propagate error.

**Processing Step 5: Visualization:** Plot observed fluxes vs. wavelength (`plt.errorbar`). Overplot the best-fit Planck model (`flux_model(wav_smooth, T_mle, Norm_mle)`) using a smooth wavelength array `wav_smooth`. Use logarithmic scales for both axes if appropriate for thermal spectra. Add title and labels (with units).

**Output, Testing, and Extension:** Output includes MLE values for T and Norm (or derived Radius) with uncertainties, minimum Chi-squared, and the plot comparing data to the best-fit Planck spectrum. **Testing:** Verify fit visually. Check if T_mle is physically reasonable for an asteroid at its distance. Compare χ²/dof to 1 for goodness-of-fit. Check unit consistency throughout the calculation. **Extensions:** (1) Use `astropy.modeling.physical_models.BlackBody` instead of manually defining the Planck function. (2) Implement a more sophisticated thermal model (like NEATM) with additional parameters (e.g., beaming parameter η, albedo pV linked via H magnitude). (3) Fit simultaneously to both reflected sunlight (optical/NIR) and thermal emission (IR) data to constrain albedo and diameter simultaneously. (4) Use Bayesian methods (Chapter 17) to get full posterior distributions for the parameters.

**Summary**

This chapter introduced the powerful framework of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for estimating the parameters of physical models based on observed data. It began by defining the crucial likelihood function, L(θ | D), which quantifies the probability (or probability density) of obtaining the observed data D given a specific set of model parameters θ. The importance of assuming independent data points, leading to the likelihood being a product (or the log-likelihood being a sum) of individual probabilities p(dᵢ | θ), was highlighted, along with the common practice of working with the more stable log-likelihood function, ln L. The connection between maximizing Gaussian likelihood and minimizing the Chi-squared statistic (weighted least squares) was established. The principle of MLE was then presented: finding the parameter values θ̂<0xE1><0xB5><0x82><0xE1><0xB5><0x87><0xE1><0xB5><0x8A> that maximize the likelihood (or log-likelihood) function, thus representing the parameters under which the observed data were most probable according to the model. While analytical solutions for MLE exist in simple cases (like estimating the mean of Gaussian data or the rate of Poisson data), most astrophysical models require numerical optimization.

Practical methods for finding the MLE numerically using algorithms available in `scipy.optimize` (particularly `minimize`) were demonstrated. This involved defining a Python function for the negative log-likelihood and passing it, along with initial parameter guesses and potentially bounds, to an optimization routine (like 'L-BFGS-B' or 'Nelder-Mead'). The desirable asymptotic properties of MLEs (consistency, efficiency, normality) were noted, making it a statistically well-grounded approach for large datasets, though contingent on the correct specification of the likelihood function. Crucially, methods for estimating the uncertainties on the MLE parameters were discussed. The common approach of using the curvature of the log-likelihood function at its peak, approximated by the inverse Hessian matrix (often returned by optimization routines like `minimize(..., method='BFGS')`), to estimate the parameter covariance matrix and standard errors was detailed. Alternative, more robust (but computationally intensive) methods like bootstrapping were introduced conceptually. Finally, the concept of profile likelihood was presented as a way to construct confidence intervals that better reflect the true shape of the likelihood function, especially in cases of non-linearity or parameter correlations, by maximizing the likelihood over nuisance parameters for fixed values of the parameter of interest. The chapter concluded with practical examples fitting a power law and a Planck function, illustrating the full MLE workflow.
