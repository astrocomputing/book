**Chapter 41: GPU Computing for Astrophysics**

Beyond utilizing multiple CPU cores or distributed nodes via MPI or Dask, modern high-performance computing increasingly leverages specialized hardware accelerators to tackle computationally intensive tasks. This chapter introduces **Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)** as powerful co-processors capable of providing massive parallelism for specific types of scientific computations relevant to astrophysics. We begin by explaining the fundamental architectural differences between CPUs and GPUs, highlighting the GPU's design with thousands of simpler cores optimized for parallel throughput (SIMD/SIMT execution). We introduce the main programming models used to harness GPU power, primarily NVIDIA's **CUDA** (Compute Unified Device Architecture) and the open standard **OpenCL**, explaining concepts like kernels, host/device code, and memory management. Our focus then shifts to accessing GPU capabilities from Python, exploring key libraries: **CuPy**, which provides a near-identical drop-in replacement for NumPy enabling array operations directly on the GPU with minimal code changes; and **Numba**, whose `@cuda.jit` decorator allows writing custom GPU **kernels** (functions executed in parallel by GPU threads) directly within Python code. We will demonstrate practical examples using CuPy for accelerating NumPy operations and Numba for writing a simple custom kernel. Finally, we discuss the crucial question of *when* GPUs are most beneficial, considering factors like **arithmetic intensity**, **data parallelism**, and the overhead associated with transferring data between the host (CPU) memory and the device (GPU) memory.

**41.1 Introduction to GPUs: Architecture (Many Cores, SIMD/SIMT)**

Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), originally designed to accelerate the demanding parallel computations required for rendering computer graphics, have evolved into powerful general-purpose parallel processors widely used in scientific computing, machine learning, and data analysis. Their architecture is fundamentally different from traditional Central Processing Units (CPUs), making them exceptionally well-suited for specific types of computationally intensive tasks often encountered in astrophysics.

While a modern CPU typically consists of a relatively small number of powerful cores (e.g., 4 to 64) optimized for low-latency execution of complex, sequential instructions (scalar operations, branching), a modern GPU contains **hundreds or thousands** of much simpler processing cores. These GPU cores are designed primarily for high-throughput execution of arithmetic operations, particularly floating-point calculations. They often operate using a **SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)** or, more accurately for modern NVIDIA GPUs, **SIMT (Single Instruction, Multiple Threads)** execution model.

In a SIMD/SIMT architecture, groups of cores (e.g., a "warp" of 32 threads in NVIDIA terminology) execute the *same* instruction simultaneously, but operate on *different* pieces of data. This is extremely efficient for tasks that involve applying the same mathematical operation independently to large arrays or vectors of data – often termed **data parallelism**. For example, adding two large vectors, multiplying matrices, applying a filter to an image, or calculating forces between many pairs of particles often involves performing the same basic arithmetic operations repeatedly across large datasets, a pattern perfectly suited for the GPU's massively parallel architecture.

To support this massive parallelism, GPUs also feature very high **memory bandwidth**. They use specialized high-speed memory (like GDDR6 or HBM) connected to the processing cores via wide memory buses, allowing them to feed data to the thousands of cores much faster than typical CPU main memory (DDR4/5) systems can supply data to a few dozen CPU cores. This high bandwidth is crucial for data-intensive computations where performance is often limited by how quickly data can be moved to the processing units.

However, GPU cores are generally simpler than CPU cores. They often have smaller caches, limited control flow capabilities (branching instructions executed by threads within the same warp can cause divergence and reduce efficiency), and are optimized for arithmetic throughput rather than the low latency required for complex single-threaded tasks or operating system functions. GPUs typically function as **co-processors** or **accelerators**, working alongside a host CPU. The main application runs on the CPU, identifies computationally intensive, data-parallel sections, transfers the necessary data from host RAM to the GPU's dedicated memory (device memory), launches the computation (a "kernel") on the GPU's cores, waits for completion, and then transfers the results back from device memory to host RAM.

This host-device interaction introduces **data transfer overhead**. Moving data across the PCIe bus (or faster interconnects like NVLink) between host RAM and GPU device memory takes time. For a computation to benefit significantly from GPU acceleration, the time saved by performing the computation in parallel on the GPU must outweigh the time spent transferring data back and forth. Problems with high **arithmetic intensity** (many computations performed per byte of data transferred) are generally better suited for GPU acceleration. Tasks involving very small datasets or requiring frequent data transfers between host and device might see little or no speedup, or even slowdowns, due to this overhead.

GPU architectures are also hierarchical. Cores are grouped into processing units (e.g., Streaming Multiprocessors or SMs in NVIDIA GPUs), each with its own shared memory, caches, and scheduling units. Understanding this hierarchy can be important for advanced optimization when writing custom kernels, allowing developers to leverage fast on-chip shared memory and coordinate threads within a block effectively.

In summary, GPUs offer massive parallelism through thousands of simple cores operating in a SIMD/SIMT fashion, coupled with very high memory bandwidth. They excel at data-parallel tasks with high arithmetic intensity. However, they function as co-processors requiring explicit data management (transfer between host and device memory) and programming models that expose their parallelism, with performance gains dependent on balancing computation speedup against data transfer overhead.

**(No specific code example here, as this section discusses hardware architecture.)**

**41.2 CUDA and OpenCL Programming Models**

To harness the massive parallelism offered by GPUs, specialized programming models and APIs are required. These models allow developers to write code that executes on the host (CPU) and launch computationally intensive sections, known as **kernels**, to run in parallel on the device (GPU). The two dominant low-level programming models for general-purpose GPU computing (GPGPU) are NVIDIA's **CUDA** and the open standard **OpenCL**.

**CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture):** Developed by NVIDIA, CUDA is a proprietary parallel computing platform and programming model specifically for NVIDIA GPUs. It includes a C/C++ based programming language extension (`CUDA C/C++`), runtime libraries, and development tools. CUDA provides a direct way to write kernels that execute across the GPU's cores and manage data transfer between host and device memory.
*   **Kernels:** Special C/C++ functions designated by `__global__` keyword. When launched from the host, a kernel executes simultaneously across a large grid of parallel **threads**.
*   **Thread Hierarchy:** Threads are organized hierarchically into **blocks**, and blocks are organized into a **grid**. Threads within the same block can cooperate efficiently using fast **shared memory** and synchronization barriers (`__syncthreads()`). Threads in different blocks execute independently. This hierarchy maps onto the GPU hardware (threads run on cores, blocks run on Streaming Multiprocessors/SMs). Each thread has unique indices (`threadIdx`, `blockIdx`, `blockDim`, `gridDim`) allowing it to determine which part of the data it should process.
*   **Memory Management:** CUDA requires explicit management of GPU device memory. Host code allocates memory on the device (`cudaMalloc`), copies data from host RAM to device memory (`cudaMemcpyHostToDevice`), launches the kernel to operate on device memory, copies results back from device memory to host RAM (`cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost`), and frees device memory (`cudaFree`).
*   **Libraries:** CUDA includes highly optimized libraries for common tasks like linear algebra (**cuBLAS**), FFTs (**cuFFT**), random number generation (**cuRAND**), sparse matrices (**cuSPARSE**), and deep learning primitives (**cuDNN**), which are often leveraged by higher-level Python libraries.
CUDA is widely adopted due to its maturity, extensive ecosystem, strong performance on NVIDIA hardware, and integration with many scientific libraries and deep learning frameworks. Its main limitation is vendor lock-in; CUDA code only runs on NVIDIA GPUs.

**OpenCL (Open Computing Language):** OpenCL is an **open standard**, managed by the Khronos Group, designed for writing programs that execute across heterogeneous platforms, including CPUs, GPUs (from various vendors like NVIDIA, AMD, Intel), DSPs, and FPGAs. Its goal is portability across different hardware accelerators.
*   **Kernels:** OpenCL kernels are typically written in a C-like language (OpenCL C).
*   **Execution Model:** Similar to CUDA, it uses concepts of kernels executed by **work-items** (analogous to threads) organized into **work-groups** (analogous to blocks) within an **NDRange** (analogous to a grid). Work-items within a work-group can potentially use local memory (similar to shared memory) and barriers for synchronization.
*   **Platform and Memory Model:** OpenCL has a more abstract platform model involving Platforms (vendors), Devices (CPUs, GPUs), Contexts (managing devices), Command Queues (submitting tasks), Buffers (device memory objects), and Kernels. Memory management involves creating buffers (`clCreateBuffer`), writing/reading data between host and device buffers (`clEnqueueWriteBuffer`, `clEnqueueReadBuffer`), setting kernel arguments, and enqueuing kernel execution (`clEnqueueNDRangeKernel`).
*   **Portability:** OpenCL's major advantage is its potential portability across hardware from different vendors.
*   **Complexity and Performance:** The API can be more verbose and complex than CUDA's runtime API. Performance might sometimes lag behind highly optimized CUDA implementations on NVIDIA hardware due to the abstraction layer, although this gap varies. Ecosystem support (libraries, tools) is generally less extensive than CUDA's.

Both CUDA and OpenCL require programming in C/C++ or OpenCL C to write the core kernel functions that run on the GPU. This involves understanding parallel execution concepts, thread hierarchies, memory management (host/device transfers, coalesced memory access, shared memory usage), and synchronization primitives. Writing efficient, low-level GPU code requires significant expertise.

Fortunately, for many common tasks in scientific Python, we don't necessarily need to write raw CUDA or OpenCL code directly. Higher-level libraries like **CuPy** and **Numba** (discussed next) provide Pythonic interfaces that abstract away much of the low-level complexity, allowing users to leverage GPU acceleration with significantly less effort, while still relying on the underlying CUDA (most commonly) or potentially OpenCL frameworks and drivers being installed on the system. Understanding the basic concepts of kernels, host/device memory, and thread hierarchies remains helpful for appreciating how these higher-level tools work and for diagnosing performance issues.

**(No specific code example here, as this section discusses the programming models, not direct Python implementation libraries.)**

**41.3 Python Libraries: `CuPy` and `Numba` (`@cuda.jit`)**

While direct programming in CUDA C++ or OpenCL C offers maximum control over GPU execution, it presents a steep learning curve for many Python users. Fortunately, several powerful Python libraries bridge this gap, allowing astrophysicists to leverage GPU acceleration for their computations directly within the familiar Python environment. Two of the most prominent and useful libraries in this domain are **CuPy** and **Numba**'s CUDA backend.

**CuPy (`pip install cupy-cudaXXX` where XXX matches CUDA version):** CuPy is an open-source library that provides a **NumPy-compatible** multi-dimensional array (`cupy.ndarray`) designed to be executed on NVIDIA GPUs using CUDA. Its core goal is to allow users to accelerate their existing NumPy code with minimal modifications. CuPy implements a large subset of the NumPy API; for many operations, changing `import numpy as np` to `import cupy as cp` is often sufficient to run the computation on the GPU.

Key features of CuPy:
*   **NumPy Compatibility:** Mirrors NumPy's array creation functions (`cp.array`, `cp.zeros`, `cp.ones`, `cp.arange`), slicing and indexing syntax, mathematical ufuncs (`cp.sin`, `cp.exp`), reductions (`cp.sum`, `cp.mean`), linear algebra (`cupy.linalg`), FFTs (`cupy.fft`), and random number generation (`cupy.random`).
*   **GPU Execution:** Operations performed on `cupy.ndarray` objects are automatically executed on the GPU using underlying CUDA libraries (like cuBLAS, cuFFT, cuRAND) for high performance.
*   **Data Transfer:** Requires explicit transfer of data between host (CPU) NumPy arrays and device (GPU) CuPy arrays using `gpu_array = cp.asarray(numpy_array)` (host to device) and `numpy_array = cp.asnumpy(gpu_array)` or `gpu_array.get()` (device to host). Minimizing these transfers is key for performance (Sec 41.6).
*   **Custom Kernels:** Allows writing and compiling custom CUDA kernels directly from Python strings (`cp.RawKernel`) for operations not covered by the standard API.
CuPy provides a remarkably easy entry point for GPU acceleration if your computation is primarily based on standard NumPy array operations. It significantly reduces the barrier to entry compared to writing raw CUDA code. Its main limitation is that it requires NVIDIA GPUs and CUDA toolkit installed.

**Numba (`@cuda.jit`) (`pip install numba`):** Numba (introduced conceptually for CPU parallelism in Sec 38.6) is a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for Python that can translate a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast machine code. Crucially, Numba also includes a CUDA backend that allows writing and compiling GPU **kernels** directly within Python using familiar Python syntax, decorated with `@cuda.jit`.

Key features of Numba's CUDA support:
*   **Writing Kernels in Python:** Define GPU kernels as standard Python functions decorated with `@numba.cuda.jit`. Inside these functions, you use special attributes provided by `numba.cuda` (like `cuda.grid(1)`, `cuda.blockIdx.x`, `cuda.threadIdx.x`, `cuda.shared.array()`, `cuda.syncthreads()`) to access thread/block indices, manage shared memory, and perform synchronization, mimicking CUDA C++ concepts but using Python syntax. The function body typically contains loops and calculations operating on array elements based on the thread's unique index.
*   **Memory Management:** Requires explicit data transfer between host NumPy arrays and device arrays using `cuda.to_device()` and `cuda.copy_to_host()`. Numba device arrays (`NumbaDeviceNDArray`) are distinct from CuPy arrays but serve a similar purpose.
*   **Kernel Launch:** Kernels are launched from the host Python code using a special syntax: `my_kernel[blocks_per_grid, threads_per_block](arg1, arg2, ...)`. `blocks_per_grid` and `threads_per_block` define the thread hierarchy (grid and block dimensions) for the parallel execution on the GPU.
*   **NumPy Subset:** Numba's CUDA kernels support a subset of NumPy functions and standard Python math operations that can be translated to GPU device code.
Numba's `@cuda.jit` provides a way to write highly customized parallel algorithms directly for the GPU using mostly Python syntax, offering more flexibility than relying solely on CuPy's pre-defined NumPy-like operations. It's suitable when you need fine-grained control over the parallel execution logic or need to implement algorithms not available in CuPy. However, writing efficient and correct Numba CUDA kernels still requires understanding parallel programming concepts like thread indexing, memory coalescing, and shared memory usage. Like CuPy, it requires NVIDIA GPUs and the CUDA toolkit.

In summary, `CuPy` provides a high-level, NumPy-like interface for accelerating array computations on NVIDIA GPUs with minimal code changes, ideal for leveraging existing GPU-accelerated libraries (cuBLAS, cuFFT). `Numba`'s `@cuda.jit` offers a lower-level approach, allowing users to write custom GPU kernels directly in Python syntax, providing more control and flexibility for implementing novel parallel algorithms not covered by standard libraries, but requiring a deeper understanding of GPU programming concepts. Both are valuable tools for tapping into GPU power from the Python ecosystem.

**41.6 When to Use GPUs: Arithmetic Intensity, Data Parallelism, Transfer Overhead**

GPUs offer tremendous potential for accelerating scientific computations, but they are not a universal solution for all problems. Understanding *when* GPU acceleration is likely to be beneficial requires considering the characteristics of the computation itself and the overheads involved in using the GPU as a co-processor. Key factors include arithmetic intensity, data parallelism, and data transfer overhead.

**Data Parallelism:** GPUs excel at **data-parallel** tasks (Sec 38.2), where the same operation or sequence of operations can be applied independently to many different data elements simultaneously. Their SIMD/SIMT architecture (Sec 41.1) with thousands of cores is specifically designed for this paradigm. Problems involving large arrays, vectors, matrices, or grids where operations can be performed element-wise or on local neighborhoods (like image filtering, matrix multiplication, element-wise physics calculations in simulations, many machine learning operations) are prime candidates for GPU acceleration. Tasks that are inherently sequential or involve complex, irregular control flow with frequent branching are generally less suitable for GPUs and might run more efficiently on CPUs.

**Arithmetic Intensity:** This metric relates the number of floating-point arithmetic operations performed to the amount of data (in bytes) moved between memory and the processing units. It's often defined as: Arithmetic Intensity = (Floating Point Operations) / (Bytes Transferred).
*   **Compute-Bound Problems (High Arithmetic Intensity):** Tasks that perform many calculations for each byte of data loaded (e.g., dense matrix multiplication, complex physics kernels with many floating-point operations per element) are often **compute-bound**. For these problems, the massive parallel processing power of the GPU can provide significant speedups, as the computation time dominates the data transfer time.
*   **Memory-Bound Problems (Low Arithmetic Intensity):** Tasks that perform relatively few calculations per byte of data transferred (e.g., simple vector addition `z = x + y`, or streaming data analysis with minimal computation per element) are often **memory-bound**. Their performance is limited by the memory bandwidth, not the processing speed. While GPUs have high memory bandwidth (Sec 41.1), the overhead of transferring data to/from the GPU might negate the computational benefits for very low-intensity tasks. Such tasks might run just as fast or even faster on a modern multi-core CPU with good memory bandwidth, especially if data transfer overhead is included.

**Data Transfer Overhead:** As mentioned previously, moving data between the host CPU's RAM and the GPU's device memory across the PCIe bus (or NVLink) incurs significant **latency** and has **finite bandwidth**. This overhead can be substantial, especially if large datasets need to be transferred frequently. For GPU acceleration to be effective, the computational speedup gained by running the kernel on the GPU must be large enough to overcome the time spent on these data transfers. Strategies to mitigate this overhead include:
*   Minimizing transfers: Keep data resident on the GPU for as long as possible, performing sequences of operations there before copying results back.
*   Overlapping transfers and computation: Using asynchronous memory copies (`cudaMemcpyAsync` in CUDA, potentially handled by libraries like CuPy/Numba) and CUDA streams allows data transfer for the next step to occur while the GPU is computing the current step.
*   Using faster interconnects: Technologies like NVLink provide higher bandwidth between GPUs and sometimes between CPU and GPU compared to standard PCIe.
*   Data compression (if applicable) before transfer.

**Algorithm Suitability:** The specific algorithm must be amenable to parallelization across the GPU's architecture. Algorithms involving highly irregular memory access patterns, frequent synchronization between distant threads, or heavy use of recursion might not map well to the GPU's strengths. Data structures and memory access patterns should ideally be designed for **coalesced memory access**, where threads within the same warp access contiguous locations in global memory simultaneously, maximizing memory bandwidth utilization.

**Problem Size:** GPU acceleration typically yields greater benefits for **larger problem sizes**. For very small arrays or datasets, the overhead of launching the kernel and transferring data can outweigh any computational speedup compared to running efficiently on the CPU cache. There is usually a break-even point in problem size above which the GPU becomes faster.

**Astrophysical Examples:**
*   **Good Candidates:** N-body direct summation for moderate N, dense linear algebra (matrix inversion, SVD), FFTs on large grids, image processing filters (convolution), deep learning training/inference, some Monte Carlo simulations, particle-based rendering.
*   **Potentially Good (depending on implementation/intensity):** Tree codes or PM gravity solvers (parts can be GPU accelerated), SPH calculations, some radiative transfer methods (especially Monte Carlo RT), stencil operations in grid codes.
*   **Less Suitable:** Highly sequential algorithms, problems dominated by complex branching logic, tasks requiring very frequent host-device communication with small data, latency-sensitive single-threaded tasks.

In practice, determining if a specific astrophysical computation will benefit from GPU acceleration often requires **profiling** the existing CPU code to identify bottlenecks and **experimenting** with GPU implementations (e.g., using CuPy or Numba). Measuring the speedup achieved (including data transfer times) for realistic problem sizes is essential. Tools like NVIDIA's `nvprof` or `Nsight Systems/Compute` help analyze the performance of CUDA applications and kernels in detail, identifying memory bottlenecks, instruction stalls, or poor occupancy.

GPUs offer a powerful avenue for accelerating specific types of data-parallel, computationally intensive tasks common in astrophysics. Libraries like CuPy and Numba make this power increasingly accessible from Python. However, achieving significant speedups requires careful consideration of algorithm suitability (data parallelism, arithmetic intensity) and managing the overhead of host-device data transfer effectively. They are a valuable tool in the HPC toolkit but should be applied selectively to problems where their massively parallel architecture can be most effectively utilized.

**Application 41.A: Accelerating De-dispersion with CuPy**

**(Paragraph 1)** **Objective:** This application demonstrates the practical use of `CuPy` (Sec 41.3) to accelerate a common signal processing task in radio astronomy, particularly pulsar searching: **de-dispersion**. It involves translating a NumPy-based de-dispersion algorithm (using FFTs) into CuPy and comparing the execution time on the CPU versus the GPU. Reinforces Sec 41.4.

**(Paragraph 2)** **Astrophysical Context:** Radio waves traveling through the ionized interstellar medium (ISM) undergo dispersion – lower frequencies are delayed relative to higher frequencies. The amount of delay depends on the integrated column density of free electrons along the line of sight, quantified by the **Dispersion Measure (DM)**. Pulsar signals, which are intrinsically broadband and pulsed, arrive at Earth smeared out in time due to this effect. **De-dispersion** is the process of correcting for this frequency-dependent delay by applying appropriate time shifts to different frequency channels to recover the sharp intrinsic pulse shape. This is a computationally intensive but essential step in searching for and timing pulsars.

**(Paragraph 3)** **Data Source:** Input data is typically **filterbank data** from a radio telescope, often stored in specialized formats (like SIGPROC `.fil` or PSRFITS) but can be represented as a 2D NumPy array `data[channel, time]` containing intensity values for different frequency channels over time. Key metadata needed are the center frequency of each channel (`freqs`), the time sampling interval (`tsamp`), and the Dispersion Measure (`DM`) value to correct for. We will simulate filterbank data.

**(Paragraph 4)** **Modules Used:** `cupy` as `cp` (requires NVIDIA GPU and CUDA), `numpy` as `np`, `time` (for timing). Functions for FFTs (`np.fft`, `cp.fft`) are central.

**(Paragraph 5)** **Technique Focus:** Direct comparison of NumPy (CPU) vs. CuPy (GPU) performance for an algorithm dominated by array operations, particularly **Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs)**. (1) Implementing the **coherent de-dispersion** algorithm using NumPy: FFT the time series for each frequency channel, calculate frequency-dependent phase shifts based on the DM and frequencies, multiply the FFT data by these phase shifts, inverse FFT to get the de-dispersed time series per channel, potentially sum channels to get the final de-dispersed time series. (2) Implementing the *exact same algorithm* using CuPy by replacing `np` calls with `cp` calls (`cp.array`, `cp.fft.fft`, `cp.exp`, `cp.fft.ifft`, `cp.sum`). (3) Carefully timing both the CPU and GPU versions, including the time taken for host-to-device (`cp.asarray`) and device-to-host (`cp.asnumpy` or `.get()`) data transfers for the GPU version. (4) Calculating and comparing the speedup.

**(Paragraph 6)** **Processing Step 1: Simulate Data and Parameters:** Create a realistic-sized dummy filterbank array `data_cpu[nchan, ntime]`. Define `freqs` array (MHz), `tsamp` (seconds), and `DM` (pc cm⁻³).

**(Paragraph 7)** **Processing Step 2: NumPy (CPU) Implementation and Timing:** Write a function `dedisperse_cpu(data, freqs, tsamp, dm)` using only NumPy functions (`np.fft.fft`, `np.fft.ifft`, etc.) to perform coherent de-dispersion. Time the execution of this function on `data_cpu`. The core steps inside involve: calculating time delays `delta_t = K_DM * dm * (freqs**-2 - f_ref**-2)`, converting to phase shifts `phase_shift = np.exp(2j * np.pi * fft_freqs * delta_t)`, applying shifts `data_fft *= phase_shift`, and inverse transforming `data_dedispersed = np.fft.ifft(data_fft)`. (Details of `K_DM` and `fft_freqs` calculation omitted here).

**(Paragraph 8)** **Processing Step 3: CuPy (GPU) Implementation and Timing:** Write a function `dedisperse_gpu(data_gpu, freqs_gpu, tsamp, dm)` using the *identical* algorithm but replacing `np` with `cp`. Time the following sequence:
    *   Transfer `data_cpu` and `freqs` to GPU: `data_gpu = cp.asarray(data_cpu)`, `freqs_gpu = cp.asarray(freqs)`.
    *   Call `dedispersed_gpu = dedisperse_gpu(...)`. Ensure GPU computation finishes using `cp.cuda.Stream.null.synchronize()`.
    *   Transfer result back (if needed for verification): `dedispersed_cpu_from_gpu = cp.asnumpy(dedispersed_gpu)`. Synchronize.
    Measure total GPU time (including transfers) and compute-only time.

**(Paragraph 9)** **Processing Step 4: Compare Results and Performance:** Verify that the numerical result from CuPy (`dedispersed_cpu_from_gpu`) is very close to the NumPy result (`dedispersed_cpu`) using `np.allclose()`. Calculate the speedup achieved by the GPU (Compute Only Speedup = time_cpu / time_gpu_compute; Total Speedup = time_cpu / time_gpu_total).

**(Paragraph 10)** **Processing Step 5: Interpretation:** Analyze the speedup. Coherent de-dispersion is dominated by FFTs, which are highly parallelizable and typically show significant acceleration on GPUs via libraries like cuFFT (used internally by `cp.fft`). Expect substantial compute speedup. The total speedup will be lower due to data transfer overhead, highlighting the importance of minimizing transfers for GPU-accelerated workflows.

**Output, Testing, and Extension:** Output includes the measured CPU time, GPU compute time, GPU transfer times, total GPU time, and calculated speedup factors. Confirmation that numerical results match. **Testing:** Verify results match between CPU/GPU implementations. Test with different data sizes (`nchan`, `ntime`) or different `DM` values. Ensure timing synchronization (`cp.cuda.Stream.null.synchronize()`) is used correctly. **Extensions:** (1) Implement the alternative **incoherent de-dispersion** method (which involves time-domain shifts rather than FFTs) and compare its performance on CPU vs GPU (might be less suitable for GPU unless implemented carefully). (2) Wrap the CuPy de-dispersion in a Numba `@vectorize(target='cuda')` function for potential further optimization or integration. (3) Explore using CuPy streams to overlap data transfers with computation (if possible for the algorithm structure). (4) Integrate this function into a larger pulsar search pipeline.

**Application 41.B: Simple N-body Force Kernel with Numba**

**(Paragraph 1)** **Objective:** This application demonstrates how to write a custom GPU compute kernel directly in Python using `Numba`'s `@cuda.jit` decorator (Sec 41.3) to parallelize a computationally intensive task: the calculation of pairwise gravitational forces in a simple N-body simulation. It illustrates the concepts of kernel definition, thread indexing, device memory management, and kernel launching from Python. Reinforces Sec 41.5.

**(Paragraph 2)** **Astrophysical Context:** As discussed extensively (Sec 31.2, 32.5, 33.1), calculating the gravitational forces between all pairs of particles is the computational core of N-body simulations. The direct summation approach, while accurate, scales as O(N²) and quickly becomes prohibitively expensive for large N on CPUs. GPUs, with their massive parallelism, are well-suited to accelerating this N² calculation for moderate N (up to ~10⁵-10⁶ depending on implementation and hardware) where direct summation might still be preferred for accuracy (e.g., in star cluster simulations) or as part of a hybrid solver.

**(Paragraph 3)** **Data Source:** Input consists of NumPy arrays representing the 3D positions (`pos[N, 3]`) and masses (`mass[N]`) of N particles. The output will be a NumPy array containing the calculated 3D acceleration vector (`acc[N, 3]`) for each particle.

**(Paragraph 4)** **Modules Used:** `numba.cuda`, `numpy`, `math` (for use inside the kernel), `time`. Requires Numba installation and a compatible NVIDIA GPU with CUDA toolkit/drivers.

**(Paragraph 5)** **Technique Focus:** Writing a custom CUDA kernel using `@cuda.jit`. (1) Defining a Python function decorated with `@cuda.jit` that takes device arrays as input. (2) Inside the kernel, using `cuda.grid(1)` to get the unique global index `i` assigned to the current thread. (3) Implementing the core logic: have thread `i` calculate the force exerted on particle `i` by looping through all other particles `j`, calculating the pairwise force using Newton's law (with softening), and accumulating the acceleration components. (4) Managing memory: explicitly transferring input arrays (`pos`, `mass`) from host (NumPy) to device (Numba device array) using `cuda.to_device()`, allocating the output array `acc` on the device using `cuda.device_array_like()`. (5) Configuring kernel launch parameters: determining the number of `threads_per_block` (e.g., 128, 256) and calculating the required `blocks_per_grid` to cover all N particles. (6) Launching the kernel: `kernel_function[blocks_per_grid, threads_per_block](...)`. (7) Synchronizing using `cuda.synchronize()` to ensure kernel completion. (8) Copying the result array `acc` back from device to host using `.copy_to_host()`. Comparing execution time with a serial CPU implementation. (Note: This implements a naive O(N²) kernel; optimized N-body kernels are much more complex).

**(Paragraph 6)** **Processing Step 1: Prepare Data:** Create NumPy arrays `pos` and `mass` for N particles. Create host array `acc_host` to store the final result. Define `G` and `softening`.

**(Paragraph 7)** **Processing Step 2: Define CUDA Kernel:** Define the `@cuda.jit` function `gravity_kernel(pos_dev, mass_dev, acc_dev, N, G_val, softening_sq)`. Inside:
    *   Get thread index `i = cuda.grid(1)`.
    *   Check bounds `if i < N:`.
    *   Initialize accumulator `ax, ay, az = 0.0, 0.0, 0.0`.
    *   Loop `for j in range(N):`.
    *   Inside loop: `if i == j: continue`. Calculate distance vector `dr`, squared distance `dist_sq`. Calculate inverse cubed distance `inv_r3 = math.pow(dist_sq + softening_sq, -1.5)`. Calculate force components and add to `ax, ay, az` (using `mass_dev[j]`).
    *   After loop, write results: `acc_dev[i, 0] = ax * G_val`, `acc_dev[i, 1] = ay * G_val`, `acc_dev[i, 2] = az * G_val`. (Note: Using `atomic.add` might be needed if multiple threads wrote to same `acc_dev` location, but here each thread `i` writes only to `acc_dev[i]`, so direct write is okay).

**(Paragraph 8)** **Processing Step 3: Allocate Device Memory and Transfer:** Use `cuda.to_device()` to copy `pos` and `mass` to `pos_device`, `mass_device`. Use `cuda.device_array_like(acc_template)` to create `acc_device` on the GPU.

**(Paragraph 9)** **Processing Step 4: Launch Kernel:** Define `threads_per_block` (e.g., 256). Calculate `blocks_per_grid = (N + threads_per_block - 1) // threads_per_block`. Launch the kernel: `gravity_kernel[blocks_per_grid, threads_per_block](pos_device, mass_device, acc_device, N, G, softening**2)`. Call `cuda.synchronize()` to wait for completion.

**(Paragraph 10)** **Processing Step 5: Retrieve Results and Compare:** Copy `acc_device` back to `acc_host` using `.copy_to_host()`. Time the GPU execution (including transfers and kernel launch). Optionally, implement a serial CPU version of the force calculation loop and time it. Calculate and print the speedup. Verify GPU results match CPU results for a small N.

**Output, Testing, and Extension:** Output includes timing results for CPU vs GPU execution and the calculated speedup. The calculated acceleration array `acc_host` is available. **Testing:** Verify numerical agreement between CPU and GPU results (within floating-point precision) for small N. Check performance scaling by varying N (expect GPU to become much faster than O(N²) CPU version for N > few thousand). Check different `threads_per_block` values. **Extensions:** (1) Implement the Leapfrog integrator using Numba kernels: one kernel for kick (update velocity using acceleration), one for drift (update position using velocity). (2) Optimize the kernel using shared memory to reduce global memory access for particle positions within a block (advanced). (3) Compare Numba kernel performance with a similar calculation performed using CuPy element-wise kernels or custom RawKernels. (4) Integrate this kernel into a simple N-body simulation loop running entirely on the GPU (keeping positions/velocities on the device between steps).

**Chapter 41 Summary**

This chapter introduced Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) as powerful hardware accelerators for tackling computationally intensive, data-parallel tasks common in astrophysics. It explained the GPU's architecture, contrasting its thousands of simpler cores optimized for high-throughput arithmetic (using SIMD/SIMT execution) and its high memory bandwidth with the fewer, more complex CPU cores designed for low-latency serial execution. The two main low-level programming models, NVIDIA's proprietary **CUDA** and the open standard **OpenCL**, were introduced, outlining core concepts like host/device code, kernels (functions running on the GPU), thread hierarchies (grids, blocks, threads), and the need for explicit management of data transfers between host (CPU) RAM and device (GPU) memory, highlighting the data transfer overhead bottleneck.

Recognizing the complexity of direct CUDA/OpenCL programming, the chapter focused on two key Python libraries enabling GPU computing: **CuPy**, which provides a near drop-in replacement for the NumPy API (`cupy.ndarray`), allowing many standard array operations to be executed directly on NVIDIA GPUs with minimal code changes by leveraging underlying CUDA libraries (cuBLAS, cuFFT, etc.); and **Numba**, whose `@cuda.jit` decorator allows writing custom GPU **kernels** directly in Python syntax, providing fine-grained control over parallel execution logic by mapping Python code (using special `numba.cuda` attributes for thread indexing and synchronization) to CUDA kernels. Practical considerations for deciding *when* to use GPUs were discussed, emphasizing the importance of **data parallelism** in the algorithm, sufficient **arithmetic intensity** (computations per byte transferred) to overcome the significant **host-device data transfer overhead**, and adequate **problem size**. Examples illustrated using CuPy to accelerate FFT-based de-dispersion and using Numba to write a custom (though naive O(N²)) kernel for N-body force calculation, comparing performance with CPU execution and highlighting the typical workflow involving data transfer, kernel launch, and result retrieval.
