**Appendix VI: Turning Your Module into a VO Service**

Appendices III and IV demonstrated how to structure, test, document, package, and collaboratively develop a scientific Python module, using the hypothetical `stellarphyslib` as an example. This appendix takes the concept a step further, exploring how such a library, capable of generating theoretical predictions or simulated data, could be transformed into a component of the **Virtual Observatory (VO)**. Instead of consuming VO data (as covered in Part II), the goal here is to become a **VO data provider**, making the outputs of your theoretical models or simulations accessible to the wider astronomical community through standard VO protocols. We will outline the necessary components for both the **backend** (integrating your physics code with VO service implementations) and the **frontend** (how users would access your simulated data). We will focus conceptually on implementing standard protocols like TAP and SCS to serve generated data. Finally, we will discuss how to **containerize** such a service using Docker for portability and ease of deployment, and briefly touch upon deployment strategies for making the service publicly accessible and potentially registering it within the VO ecosystem.

**A.VI.1 From Physics Module to Data Service**

The core idea is to leverage the functions and classes within your scientific Python module (like `stellarphyslib`, capable of generating stellar properties, simple spectra, or population statistics based on input parameters or models) and expose these capabilities through standardized web interfaces defined by the Virtual Observatory. Instead of researchers needing to download, install, and run your specific code locally to generate data, they could query your deployed service using familiar VO tools (`pyvo`, `astroquery`, TOPCAT, Aladin) just as they query observational archives.

This transformation involves adding a **service layer** on top of your core scientific code. This layer acts as an intermediary, receiving requests formatted according to VO protocols (e.g., a TAP query asking for simulated stars with certain properties, or an SCS query for simulated stars in a sky region), translating these requests into calls to your underlying `stellarphyslib` functions to generate the required data on-the-fly or retrieve it from a pre-computed cache/database, and then formatting the results into the standard VO response format, typically a **VOTable** (Sec 8.2, 2.6).

Why turn a theoretical/simulation module into a VO service?
*   **Accessibility:** Makes theoretical predictions or simulated datasets readily accessible to a broader audience without requiring them to install and run complex code. Users can interact via standard tools.
*   **Reproducibility:** A well-defined service provides a reproducible way to generate data based on specific model versions and parameters.
*   **Interoperability:** Allows direct comparison of theoretical/simulated data with observational data within the same VO tools and workflows.
*   **Testing and Validation:** Provides a testbed for VO client tools or analysis workflows using controlled, simulated data served via standard protocols.
*   **Education:** Offers a platform for students to explore theoretical models interactively.

The key challenge lies in implementing the VO protocol server endpoints correctly and efficiently. This typically involves:
1.  Choosing a Python web framework (like Flask, FastAPI, Django) to handle incoming HTTP requests.
2.  Parsing the VO query parameters (e.g., RA/Dec/SR for SCS, ADQL query string for TAP).
3.  Calling the underlying scientific functions from your module (e.g., `stellarphyslib`) to generate the requested data based on the parsed parameters.
4.  Formatting the generated data (e.g., lists of simulated star properties) into a VOTable structure using libraries like `astropy.io.votable`.
5.  Returning the VOTable as the HTTP response.

This requires understanding both the specifics of the VO protocols (SCS, TAP request/response formats) and how to build basic web services in Python. The underlying `stellarphyslib` module itself might need functions designed to generate data suitable for serving (e.g., a function `generate_stars_in_cone(ra, dec, radius, params)` or `execute_simulated_query(adql_query)`).

It's important to distinguish this from *client-side* VO usage. Here, we are not *querying* external VO services, but *building* a service that *responds* to standard VO queries by serving simulated or theoretically generated data, effectively making our model a node within the Virtual Observatory ecosystem.

**A.VI.2 Backend: Combining Physics Code and VO Services**

The backend of our hypothetical `stellarphyslib` VO service consists of two main parts: the core scientific code responsible for generating the simulated data, and the web service layer that implements the VO protocols (TAP, SCS, etc.) and handles communication.

**1. Core Physics/Generation Module (`stellarphyslib`):** This is the Python package developed as in Appendix III. For serving simulated data, it needs functions capable of generating populations of objects or specific data products based on input parameters. Examples:
*   `generate_stellar_population(n_stars, imf_params, age_range, metallicity)`: Returns a table/DataFrame of star properties (ID, mass, age, Z, position, velocity).
*   `get_properties_in_cone(ra_center, dec_center, radius, population_params)`: Generates or filters a population to return stars within a sky cone. Output should match expected SCS VOTable columns (ID, RA, Dec, potentially magnitude).
*   `get_simulated_spectrum(star_id or params)`: Generates a simple theoretical spectrum (e.g., blackbody based on Teff derived from mass/age, or lookup from pre-computed SPS grids) for a given star. Output needs to be formattable as FITS or within a VOTable.
*   `query_simulated_catalog(adql_select_clause, adql_where_clause, ...)`: A function that can parse simplified ADQL clauses and apply corresponding filters/selections to an *in-memory* or database representation of a pre-generated or on-the-fly generated stellar population catalog. This is needed for the TAP service.
These functions would use NumPy, SciPy, and Astropy as needed for calculations. The key is designing them to produce outputs easily mappable to standard VO table or data formats.

**2. VO Service Implementation (Web Framework + VOTable Generation):** This layer handles the web requests and VO protocol logic.
*   **Web Framework:** A lightweight framework like **Flask** or **FastAPI** is typically sufficient. It routes incoming HTTP requests (e.g., to `/scs`, `/tap/sync`, `/tap/tables`) to specific Python handler functions.
*   **Parsing Requests:** Handler functions need to parse parameters from the request URL (for GET requests like SCS) or request body (for POST requests like TAP queries). Query parameters like `RA`, `DEC`, `SR` (for SCS) or `QUERY`, `LANG`, `FORMAT` (for TAP) must be extracted and validated. ADQL queries submitted to TAP need parsing (potentially using `pyvo`'s ADQL parser or other dedicated libraries, though full ADQL parsing is complex).
*   **Calling Generation Code:** The parsed parameters are passed to the appropriate functions in the `stellarphyslib` backend to generate the required simulated data (e.g., call `get_properties_in_cone`).
*   **Generating VOTable Responses:** The data returned by the backend functions (e.g., a list of star coordinates and magnitudes, or rows matching an ADQL query) needs to be formatted into a valid **VOTable** XML document. The `astropy.io.votable` submodule is the key tool here.
    *   Create an `astropy.table.Table` object from the generated data.
    *   Define VOTable `<FIELD>` elements corresponding to the table columns, including `name`, `datatype`, `unit`, and ideally `ucd`.
    *   Create `astropy.io.votable.tree.VOTableFile` and `Resource` objects.
    *   Add the `Table` to the `Resource`.
    *   Write the VOTable structure to an in-memory string buffer (`io.BytesIO`) using `votable_file.to_xml(fileobj)`.
    *   Return this XML string as the HTTP response with the correct MIME type (`application/x-votable+xml`).
*   **Implementing Standard Endpoints:**
    *   **SCS:** Implement an endpoint (e.g., `/scs`) that accepts `RA`, `DEC`, `SR`, calls the backend generator, and returns a VOTable of simulated sources in the cone.
    *   **TAP:** Requires more endpoints:
        *   `/tap/tables`: Returns a VOTable describing the available simulated tables (e.g., `stellarphyslib.sim_population`) and their columns.
        *   `/tap/capabilities`: Returns a VOTable describing the service's capabilities (supported ADQL version, etc.).
        *   `/tap/sync` (and/or `/async`): Accepts an ADQL `QUERY`, parses it (potentially a limited subset of ADQL), executes it against the simulated data (filtering/selecting rows from the generated population), and returns the results as a VOTable. Asynchronous support adds significant complexity.

**Data Handling Strategy:** A key design choice is whether the simulated data is generated **on-the-fly** for each request or if a large population is **pre-generated** and stored (e.g., in memory as a Pandas DataFrame, in a local database like SQLite, or in efficient file formats like Parquet or HDF5) which the VO service then queries.
*   **On-the-fly:** Lower storage requirements, always uses the latest model version. Can be slow if generation is computationally expensive. Might struggle with queries requiring access to the full population (e.g., complex ADQL joins or global statistics).
*   **Pre-generated:** Faster response times for queries (especially TAP). Allows complex queries on the full dataset. Requires significant storage if the population is large. Data reflects the version of the model used for pre-generation.
A hybrid approach might also be possible.

# Explanation: This code defines a basic Flask web application that implements an SCS endpoint.
# 1. It imports Flask, request (to get URL parameters), Response (to send custom response), 
#    and Astropy's Table/VOTable tools.
# 2. It conceptually imports or defines the backend function `generate_stars_in_cone`.
# 3. `@app.route('/scs', methods=['GET'])` defines a function to handle GET requests to the /scs path.
# 4. Inside `simple_cone_search`:
#    - It parses RA, DEC, SR parameters from the URL query string (`request.args`).
#    - It calls the backend function `generate_stars_in_cone` with these parameters.
#    - It converts the returned data (list of dicts) into an `astropy.table.Table`.
#    - It defines the VOTable `<FIELD>` structure expected for SCS results (with names, types, units, UCDs).
#    - It uses `VOTableFile.from_table` and related objects to create the VOTable XML structure.
#    - It writes the VOTable XML to an in-memory buffer using `votable.to_xml()`.
#    - It returns this XML content as an HTTP `Response` with the correct VOTable MIME type.
# The commented-out `if __name__ == '__main__':` block shows how to run this Flask app locally for testing. 
# Accessing the specified URL in a browser or with `curl` would execute the query.
# This demonstrates the essential steps: receive request, call backend, format as VOTable, return response. 
# A TAP service would be significantly more complex due to ADQL parsing and execution logic.
```

Building the backend requires combining web development skills (using Flask/FastAPI), scientific programming skills (implementing the core `stellarphyslib` generators), and knowledge of VO standards (specifically VOTable formatting and protocol requirements). Implementing TAP with ADQL support is considerably more involved than implementing the simpler SCS protocol.

**A.VI.3 Frontend: Accessing the Simulated VO Service**

Once the backend service implementing VO protocols (like SCS or TAP) for the `stellarphyslib` simulated data is running and accessible via a URL (e.g., `http://my-stellarvo.org/tap` or `http://localhost:5000/scs` if running locally), users can interact with it using standard VO client tools, just as they would with services providing real observational data. This seamless frontend access is a major advantage of adhering to VO standards.

**Using `pyvo`:** The `pyvo` library (Sec 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, App II), designed for interacting with VO services, can connect directly to your custom service endpoint. Users simply need to know the service URL and the protocol it implements.
*   **For SCS:**
    ```python
    import pyvo as vo
    from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord
    from astropy import units as u
    
    scs_service_url = "http://your-stellarvo-service.edu/scs" # Replace with actual URL
    try:
        service = vo.dal.SCSService(scs_service_url)
        center = SkyCoord(ra=185*u.deg, dec=15*u.deg, frame='icrs')
        radius = 0.2 * u.deg
        results = service.search(pos=center, radius=radius.to(u.deg).value)
        simulated_table = results.to_table() 
        print(f"Retrieved {len(simulated_table)} simulated stars via SCS:")
        # print(simulated_table)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error querying simulated SCS service: {e}")
    ```
*   **For TAP:**
    ```python
    import pyvo as vo
    
    tap_service_url = "http://your-stellarvo-service.edu/tap" # Replace with actual URL
    adql_query = "SELECT TOP 100 ID, RA, Dec, Mass, Age FROM stellarphyslib.sim_population WHERE Mass > 1.0 AND Age < 1e9"
    try:
        service = vo.dal.TAPService(tap_service_url)
        # Check available tables (optional)
        # tables = service.tables
        # print(f"Available tables: {tables.keys()}")
        
        # Run synchronous query
        results = service.search(query=adql_query, language="ADQL") 
        simulated_table = results.to_table()
        print(f"Retrieved {len(simulated_table)} simulated stars via TAP/ADQL:")
        # print(simulated_table)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error querying simulated TAP service: {e}")
    ```
From the client's perspective using `pyvo`, querying the simulated service is identical to querying real services hosted by major archives, provided the backend service correctly implements the protocol and returns valid VOTables.

**Using `astroquery`:** Similarly, `astroquery` modules that wrap standard VO protocols might work if the service URL is known or if the service is registered in a VO registry that `astroquery` queries. For instance, `astroquery.vo_conesearch.conesearch(center=..., radius=..., catalog_db=scs_service_url)` could potentially query the custom SCS service if the URL is passed directly (depending on `astroquery`'s flexibility).

**Using Graphical VO Tools (TOPCAT, Aladin):** Desktop applications like TOPCAT and Aladin are designed to interact with standard VO services.
*   **TOPCAT:** Can perform SCS queries via its Cone Search window or execute complex ADQL queries against TAP services via its TAP query window. Users would simply need to enter the base URL of your simulated SCS or TAP service endpoint. The results (VOTables) would load directly into TOPCAT for analysis and visualization.
*   **Aladin:** Can perform SCS queries or query image/cube services (SIA/SSAP) via their respective interfaces, overlaying results on its sky atlas. If your service provided SCS results with RA/Dec, Aladin could potentially display the locations of your simulated stars.

**Custom Web Frontend (Optional):** While adhering to VO protocols ensures compatibility with standard tools, the web framework used in the backend (Flask, FastAPI) can also easily serve simple HTML web pages. You could create a basic web form where users can input parameters (e.g., RA/Dec/SR for SCS, or basic filters for TAP) and see the results displayed directly on a web page, perhaps as an HTML table or a simple plot generated server-side. This can provide a user-friendly interface alongside the programmatic VO endpoints.

The key advantage of implementing standard VO protocols in the backend is that it makes the simulated data or model outputs immediately accessible through a wide range of existing, familiar frontend tools used by the astronomical community. Researchers don't need to learn a new custom API for every simulation or theoretical model; they can use the same `pyvo`, `astroquery`, TOPCAT, or Aladin skills they use for accessing observational data, greatly enhancing the usability and interoperability of theoretical datasets. The frontend interaction becomes standardized and familiar.

**(The Python code snippets using `pyvo` above serve as the primary code examples for this section, illustrating frontend access.)**

**A.VI.4 Containerization and Deployment**

Once the `stellarphyslib` VO service backend (Sec A.VI.2) is developed and tested locally, making it accessible to collaborators or the wider community requires **deployment** onto a stable server environment. Furthermore, ensuring that the service runs reliably with all its specific software dependencies (Python version, libraries like Flask/FastAPI, Astropy, NumPy, `stellarphyslib` itself) across different deployment environments (local testing, institutional server, cloud platform) is crucial for reproducibility. **Containerization**, particularly using **Docker**, provides the standard solution for packaging the application and its dependencies together into a portable, self-contained unit.

**Containerization with Docker:** Docker allows you to package your application (the Flask/FastAPI web service and the `stellarphyslib` code), its Python dependencies, required system libraries, and runtime configurations into a standardized, lightweight, executable image. This image can then be run consistently on any machine or cloud platform that has Docker installed, eliminating "works on my machine" problems caused by differing environments.

The process involves creating a **`Dockerfile`** in the project's root directory. This text file contains instructions for building the Docker image step-by-step:
1.  **Base Image:** Start from an official Python base image (`FROM python:3.10-slim`).
2.  **Set Working Directory:** Define the working directory inside the container (`WORKDIR /app`).
3.  **Copy Requirements:** Copy the Python dependency file (`requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`) into the container (`COPY requirements.txt .`). A `requirements.txt` can be generated from `pyproject.toml` or listed manually, including `Flask`, `astropy`, `numpy`, `gunicorn` (a production web server), etc., and potentially `stellarphyslib` itself if packaged separately.
4.  **Install Dependencies:** Run `pip install` inside the container to install all necessary packages (`RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`).
5.  **Copy Application Code:** Copy the rest of your application code (the Flask/FastAPI app file, the `stellarphyslib` package directory) into the container's working directory (`COPY . .`).
6.  **Expose Port:** Inform Docker that the application inside the container will listen on a specific network port (e.g., port 8000 used by FastAPI/uvicorn or Flask development server) (`EXPOSE 8000`).
7.  **Define Runtime Command:** Specify the command to execute when a container is started from the image. This should launch the web server running your Flask/FastAPI application (e.g., using `gunicorn` for Flask: `CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000", "wsgi:app"]`, or `uvicorn` for FastAPI: `CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]`).

```dockerfile
# --- Example Dockerfile for a Flask-based VO Service ---
# (Assumes Flask app is in 'app.py', stellarphyslib is installable, 
#  and requirements.txt exists)

# 1. Base Image
FROM python:3.10-slim

# 2. Set Working Directory

# 3. Copy Requirements file
COPY requirements.txt .

# 4. Install Dependencies
# --no-cache-dir reduces image size
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
# If stellarphyslib is packaged, requirements.txt should include a line like:
# ./ # Installs package from local source copied in next step
# Or install it explicitly after copying code if needed: RUN pip install .

# 5. Copy Application Code
# Copy the Flask app file and the stellarphyslib package directory
COPY ./app.py . 
COPY ./stellarphyslib ./stellarphyslib 
# Ensure stellarphyslib is installed if not done via requirements.txt
# RUN pip install . # If needed

# 6. Expose Port (the port the application *inside* the container listens on)

print("-" * 20)
```

**Building and Running the Container:**
*   **Build:** Navigate to the project root directory in the terminal and run `docker build -t stellarvo-service:latest .`. This builds the image based on the `Dockerfile` instructions and tags it as `stellarvo-service:latest`.
*   **Run:** Start a container from the image: `docker run -d -p 8080:8000 --name stellarvo stellarvo-service:latest`.
    *   `-d`: Run in detached mode (background).
    *   `-p 8080:8000`: Maps port 8080 on the host machine to port 8000 inside the container (the one exposed and used by the web server). Users would access the service via `http://localhost:8080` (or the host machine's IP).
    *   `--name stellarvo`: Assigns a name to the running container for easier management (`docker stop stellarvo`, `docker logs stellarvo`).

**Deployment Strategies:** Once containerized, the service can be deployed in various ways:
*   **Local Docker:** Run directly on a local machine or server with Docker installed for testing or personal use.
*   **Institutional HPC/Servers:** Deploy the container on institutional servers or Kubernetes clusters if supported by the IT infrastructure.
*   **Cloud Platforms:** Use cloud container orchestration services like Amazon ECS/EKS, Google Cloud Run/GKE, or Azure Container Instances/AKS to deploy the image for scalable and potentially public access. This requires cloud platform expertise and incurs costs.
*   **Serverless Platforms:** Some simple API endpoints might be deployable using serverless functions (like AWS Lambda with API Gateway), although managing dependencies and cold starts can be challenging.

**VO Registration:** For the service to be discoverable by the wider Virtual Observatory community, its standard endpoints (TAP `/sync`, `/tables`, `/capabilities`; SCS `/scs`) need to be described using the IVOA VOResource XML standard, and this description needs to be submitted to a **VO Publishing Registry**. This step formally integrates the simulated service into the VO ecosystem, allowing tools to find it via registry queries (Sec 8.6).

Containerization with Docker provides a robust solution for packaging the VO service application and all its dependencies, ensuring it runs consistently across different environments. Combined with cloud deployment platforms or institutional servers, it enables making theoretical models or simulation outputs accessible as standardized, reliable VO services to the astrophysical community, promoting interoperability between theory and observation.

**Appendix VI Summary**

This appendix outlined the process of transforming a scientific Python package, exemplified by the hypothetical `stellarphyslib`, into a functioning component of the **Virtual Observatory (VO)**, acting as a **data provider** serving simulated or theoretically generated data via standard VO protocols. The core idea involves building a service layer, typically using a Python web framework like Flask or FastAPI, on top of the core scientific code. This service layer intercepts incoming HTTP requests formatted according to VO protocols (like Simple Cone Search - SCS, or Table Access Protocol - TAP), parses the request parameters (RA/Dec/SR or ADQL queries), calls the underlying physics functions within the package to generate the required simulated data (either on-the-fly or from a pre-computed cache), and meticulously formats the results into standard **VOTable** XML documents using libraries like `astropy.io.votable` before returning them as the HTTP response. The **backend** thus consists of the scientific code and the VO service implementation, while the **frontend** involves users accessing the service seamlessly via standard VO client tools (`pyvo`, `astroquery`, TOPCAT, Aladin) simply by pointing them to the service's URL endpoint.

Recognizing the need for portability, reproducibility, and ease of deployment, the appendix detailed the process of **containerizing** the VO service application using **Docker**. This involves creating a `Dockerfile` that specifies instructions for building a self-contained image: starting from a base Python image, installing all necessary Python dependencies (Flask/FastAPI, Astropy, `stellarphyslib` itself, etc.) listed in a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`, copying the application code into the image, exposing the network port used by the web service, and defining the command to launch the service (e.g., using `gunicorn` or `uvicorn`) when the container starts. Building (`docker build`) and running (`docker run`) the container allows the service to be executed consistently in any environment supporting Docker. Deployment options ranging from local execution for testing to deploying the container image on institutional servers or scalable cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) were discussed. Finally, the importance of potentially registering the deployed service endpoints with a VO Publishing Registry to ensure discoverability within the broader VO ecosystem was mentioned.
