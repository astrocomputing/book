**Detailed Chapter Outline with Applications:**

**Part I: Astrophysical Data Representation** (Chapters 1-6)

*   **Chapter 1: The Landscape of Astrophysical Data**
    *   **Itemized Content:**
        *   **Data Sources:** Overview of ground-based (optical, radio, etc.) and space-based (Hubble, JWST, Chandra, etc.) telescopes, large surveys (SDSS, Gaia, LSST), numerical simulations, and laboratory data relevant to astrophysics.
        *   **Fundamental Data Types:** Defining and providing examples of Images (2D arrays), Spectra (1D flux vs. wavelength/frequency), Time Series (measurements vs. time), Catalogs (tabular data), Data Cubes (e.g., IFU data, simulation slices), Event Lists (photon arrival data from X-ray/Gamma-ray).
        *   **Data Processing Levels:** Distinguishing Raw (telemetry), Calibrated (instrument signature removed), and Science-Ready (analysis-level) data products.
        *   **Metadata:** Explaining the concept of "data about data," including observational parameters, calibration info, processing steps stored typically in headers.
        *   **Provenance:** Defining the record of data origin and processing history, crucial for reproducibility.
        *   **Astrophysical Data Challenges:** Discussing Volume (e.g., LSST Petabytes), Velocity (e.g., ZTF alert streams), Variety (multi-wavelength, multi-messenger), and Veracity (uncertainties, systematics).
    *   **Astrophysical Applications:**
        1.  **Survey Data Product Identification (Extragalactic):** A researcher wants to study galaxy morphology using LSST data. This involves identifying the necessary data products: calibrated wide-field images for visual inspection and shape measurements, and object catalogs containing positions, magnitudes, and pre-computed shape parameters. Understanding the *variety* and *volume* is key to planning the analysis. **Packages:** (Conceptual understanding, no specific code yet).
        2.  **Multi-wavelength Data Assembly (Stellar/SNR):** To study a supernova remnant (SNR), data needs to be gathered across wavelengths: X-ray photon event lists from Chandra (`event list`), optical narrow-band images from Hubble (`image`), radio continuum maps from VLA (`image`), and potentially infrared spectra (`spectrum`/`data cube`). This highlights the *variety* of data types involved. **Packages:** (Conceptual understanding, defining data needs).

            -   Output: A phase-folded light curve plot, clearly showing the transit centered at phase 0.
                
            -   Test: Verify the transit is centered near phase 0. Check if the depth matches expectations for the planet. Ensure axis labels are correct.
                
            -   Extension: Overplot a transit model (e.g., from batman package or a simple box/trapezoid) using the known parameters. Bin the phase-folded data points (e.g., using scipy.stats.binned_statistic) and overplot the binned averages with error bars.
                
        -   1.  **Gravitational Waves: Plotting Strain Data and Spectrogram**
                
            
            -   Technique Focus: Plotting time series (plot), generating and displaying a spectrogram (specgram) (Sections 6.1, 6.2, 6.5).
                
            -   Data Source: Sample LIGO strain data (time series) containing a simulated gravitational wave signal (e.g., from GWOSC tutorials or gwpy sample data).
                
            -   Modules Used:  matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, gwpy (optional, for data loading/handling).
                
            -   Processing: Load time t and strain h(t). Create a figure with two subplots using plt.subplots(2, 1). In the top subplot, plot strain vs. time using ax[0].plot(t, h). Add labels and title. In the bottom subplot, use ax[1].specgram(h, Fs=sample_rate) where sample_rate is the data sampling rate (e.g., 4096 Hz). Add labels ("Time [s]", "Frequency [Hz]") and a colorbar. Adjust frequency range if needed (ylim).
                
            -   Output: A two-panel plot showing the strain time series in the top panel and its corresponding spectrogram (time-frequency representation) in the bottom panel, potentially showing the characteristic "chirp" of a GW signal.
                
            -   Test: Check if the time axes align in both plots. Verify the frequency range displayed in the spectrogram. See if a chirp pattern is visible if a signal is present.
                
            -   Extension: Apply a bandpass filter to the strain data using scipy.signal before plotting and creating the spectrogram. Whiten the data before creating the spectrogram to enhance signal visibility. Use gwpy's built-in plotting methods which often simplify these steps.

Simplify for example: N ≈ A * I * Tex (assuming optically thin, Tex >> T0). A is constant with negligible error.
                
            -   Modules Used:  numpy. Manual calculation. Optionally uncertainties package.

Calculate relative errors: rel_err_I = err_I / I, rel_err_Tex = err_Tex / Tex. Calculate relative error on N (rule for multiplication): rel_err_N = np.sqrt(rel_err_I**2 + rel_err_Tex**2). Calculate absolute error: err_N = N * rel_err_N.

            -   Test: Manually calculate the expected frequencies under the null hypothesis (same overall rate). Verify the degrees of freedom is (rows-1)*(cols-1) = 1.
                
            -   Extension: Repeat the test but assume different numbers (e.g., Survey 2 found only 40 candidates). See how the p-value changes. Use Fisher's exact test (scipy.stats.fisher_exact) which is more accurate for small sample sizes or low expected frequencies.

            -   Data Source: A small array of pixel temperature fluctuation values (ΔT/T) from a simulated or real CMB map patch (e.g., from Planck or WMAP archives, potentially sample data). Assume theory predicts these fluctuations should be Gaussian distributed with mean 0 and a specific standard deviation σ (calculated from theory or measured robustly from the map).
                
            -   Modules Used:  scipy.stats.kstest, scipy.stats.norm, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot.

            -   Output: The K-S statistic (D) and the p-value. A statement interpreting the p-value: "Based on the p-value of Y and alpha=0.05, we reject/fail to reject the null hypothesis that the CMB temperature fluctuations in this patch are drawn from a Gaussian distribution."
                
            -   Test: Generate purely Gaussian random data using numpy.random.normal with the same mean/std dev and run the kstest on it; the p-value should generally be large. Introduce some non-Gaussian outliers into the data and see if the p-value decreases.
                
            -   Extension: Plot the empirical CDF of the data (numpy.histogram with cumulative=True, or directly) and overlay the theoretical Gaussian CDF (scipy.stats.norm.cdf) to visually assess the agreement tested by the K-S statistic.

Define the ODE function `lane_emden_eom(xi, y, n)` where `y = [theta, dtheta_dxi]`. Use `solve_ivp` starting from center (ξ=0, θ=1, dθ/dξ=0). Integrate outwards until θ approaches 0 (the surface). This requires stopping the integration based on the state vector value.

Adjust central density and repeat until boundary conditions are satisfied. This is closer to how real stellar structure is solved.

            *   *Processing:* Explain the pair counting problem (calculating correlation function requires counting pairs within distance bins). *Shared Memory Approach (`multiprocessing`):* Divide the *outer* loop of the pair counting (iterating through galaxy `i`) among processes, with each process having access to the full galaxy list to find pairs `j > i`. *Distributed Memory Approach (MPI):* Distribute the galaxy catalog itself among processes (domain decomposition). Each process calculates pairs within its local data and potentially cross-pairs with data on neighboring processes (requiring communication).
            *   *Output:* A textual description comparing the shared memory (`multiprocessing` on one node) and distributed memory (MPI across multiple nodes) approaches for parallelizing the pair counting task, highlighting data access and communication differences.
            *   *Test:* N/A (Conceptual).
            *   *Extension:* Write a simple (potentially slow) serial pair counting function using `scipy.spatial.KDTree.query_pairs` or nested loops. Discuss how communication would work in the MPI approach (e.g., sending boundary region data to neighbors).

    *   **Astrophysical Applications:**
        *   1.  **Simulation Analysis: Parallel Calculation of Global Average Property**
            *   *Technique Focus:* Using MPI collective communication (`scatter`, `reduce`) to distribute data and aggregate results across multiple processes/nodes (Sections 39.2, 39.3).
            *   *Data Source:* Large NumPy array representing particle data (e.g., temperature) loaded by rank 0.
            *   *Modules Used:* `mpi4py.MPI`, `numpy`.
            *   *Processing:* Get `comm`, `rank`, `size`. Rank 0 loads/creates full data array. Create `recvbuf` on all ranks. Rank 0 uses `comm.Scatter(sendbuf, recvbuf, root=0)` to distribute data chunks. Each rank calculates the sum of its local data chunk (`local_sum = np.sum(recvbuf)`). Each rank also gets its local count `local_n = len(recvbuf)`. Use `comm.reduce(local_sum, op=MPI.SUM, root=0)` to get `total_sum`. Use `comm.reduce(local_n, op=MPI.SUM, root=0)` to get `total_n`. Rank 0 calculates `global_average = total_sum / total_n`.
            *   *Output:* Rank 0 prints the calculated global average temperature.
            *   *Test:* Run the script serially (or with size=1) and calculate the average using standard NumPy; verify the MPI result matches. Run with different numbers of processes (e.g., 2, 4, 8) and check the result remains consistent.
            *   *Extension:* Use `comm.Bcast` to broadcast the global average calculated by rank 0 back to all other processes. Calculate the standard deviation in parallel using reductions for sum and sum-of-squares. Modify to handle cases where data size is not perfectly divisible by `size`.
        *   2.  **Data Processing: Parallel Filtering of Large Image (Distributed)**
            *   *Technique Focus:* Distributing array data (image strips) using `Scatter`/`Gather` for buffer-like data (NumPy arrays), performing local computation (Sections 39.1, 39.2, 39.3).
            *   *Data Source:* Large 2D NumPy array representing an astronomical image, created/loaded by rank 0.
            *   *Modules Used:* `mpi4py.MPI`, `numpy`, `scipy.ndimage`.
            *   *Processing:* Get `comm`, `rank`, `size`. Rank 0 creates image `img`. Calculate chunk size per rank. Create `sendbuf` (full image on rank 0), `recvbuf` (strip size on all ranks), `gatherbuf` (full image size on rank 0). Use `comm.Scatter(sendbuf, recvbuf, root=0)` (note: requires contiguous data, careful with array slicing/copying if needed). Each rank applies filter `filtered_strip = scipy.ndimage.median_filter(recvbuf, size=3)`. Use `comm.Gather(filtered_strip, gatherbuf, root=0)`. Rank 0 now has the full filtered image in `gatherbuf`.
            *   *Output:* Rank 0 saves the gathered filtered image to a file or displays it (if possible/small enough).
            *   *Test:* Compare the gathered filtered image from the MPI run with the result of applying the same filter serially to the entire image using SciPy. Check boundaries between strips for correctness (basic example ignores boundary handling).
            *   *Extension:* Implement proper handling of boundaries between image strips: each process sends its boundary rows to neighbors using `comm.Send`/`comm.Recv` and receives boundary rows from neighbors before applying the filter to have the necessary halo/ghost zone data. Use non-blocking communication (`comm.Isend`/`comm.Irecv`) to overlap communication and computation.

            *   *Technique Focus:* Using `dask.bag` for simple parallel processing of many independent items (filenames) using familiar functional programming style (`map`, `filter`, `compute`) (Sections 40.4, 40.5, 40.6).
            *   *Data Source:* A text file `lightcurve_files.txt` listing paths to thousands of individual light curve FITS files.
            *   *Modules Used:* `dask.bag`, `dask.diagnostics.ProgressBar`, `astropy.io.fits`, `astropy.stats`, `numpy`.
            *   *Processing:* Define function `calculate_rms(filename)`: opens FITS, reads flux, calculates/returns robust RMS (e.g., `astropy.stats.mad_std`). Create bag `b = db.read_text('lightcurve_files.txt').map(calculate_rms)`. Compute results `results = b.compute()`. Use `ProgressBar().register()` for progress display.
            *   *Output:* A list containing the RMS value calculated for each light curve file. A histogram plot of the distribution of RMS values.
            *   *Test:* Run on a small subset of files first. Verify the calculated RMS values are reasonable. Check if computation uses multiple cores locally.
            *   *Extension:* Set up a Dask Distributed cluster (even locally using `Client()`) and re-run the computation to see how task distribution works. Filter the bag first (`b.filter(lambda filename: 'sector-10' in filename).map(...)`) to only process files from a specific sector. Instead of RMS, run a more complex analysis like a Box Least Squares period search within the `map` function.
        *   2.  **Image Processing: Defining a Calibration Workflow with Snakemake**
            *   *Technique Focus:* Defining a multi-step computational workflow with dependencies using a workflow manager (Snakemake) (Sections 40.2, 40.3).

Define rule `master_bias`: input=`expand('raw/bias_{i}.fits', i=...)`, output=`'calib/master_bias.fits'`, shell command=`"python combine_bias.py {input} {output}"`. Define rule `master_flat`: input=`expand('raw/flat_{i}.fits', i=...)`, uses master bias, output=`'calib/master_flat.fits'`, shell=`"python combine_flat.py {input} calib/master_bias.fits {output}"`. Define rule `calibrate_science`: input=`raw='raw/sci_{img}.fits', bias='calib/master_bias.fits', flat='calib/master_flat.fits'`, output=`'calib/calibrated_{img}.fits'`, shell=`"python calibrate.py {input.raw} {input.bias} {input.flat} {output}"`. (Helper python scripts need to be created).
            *   *Output:* The `Snakefile`. Running `snakemake -j 4 calib/calibrated_image1.fits` will execute the necessary steps (combine bias, combine flat, calibrate) potentially in parallel. Calibrated FITS files created in `calib/` directory.
            *   *Test:* Check timestamps of output files to verify dependencies were respected. Manually run the Python helper scripts to ensure they work correctly. Delete an intermediate file (e.g., `master_flat.fits`) and re-run snakemake to see it gets regenerated.
            *   *Extension:* Add rules for cosmic ray rejection or background subtraction. Parameterize rules (e.g., flat field filter name). Configure Snakemake to submit jobs to an HPC cluster scheduler (e.g., SLURM) instead of running locally.

    *   41.5 Writing Custom CUDA Kernels with `Numba`. Decorator, kernel launch, memory management. *Objective:* Learn to write custom GPU kernels in Python. *Modules:* `numba.cuda`, `numpy`, `math`.
    *   41.6 When to Use GPUs: Arithmetic intensity, data parallelism, transfer overhead. *Objective:* Understand suitability of problems for GPUs.
    *   **Astrophysical Applications:**
        *   1.  **Radio Astronomy/Pulsars: Accelerating De-dispersion with CuPy**
            *   *Technique Focus:* Using `CuPy` as a drop-in replacement for `NumPy` to accelerate array operations (FFTs, multiplications) involved in de-dispersion (Section 41.4).
            *   *Data Source:* Simulated or real radio telescope filterbank data (frequency-time array, shape N_channels x N_samples). Dispersion Measure (DM) value.
            *   *Modules Used:* `cupy` as cp, `numpy` as np, `time`.
            *   *Processing:* Load/create data `cpu_data` (N_chan x N_time). Define frequencies `freqs` (N_chan). Calculate time delays per channel `delays = 4.15e3 * DM * (freqs**-2 - freqs_ref**-2)`. Perform de-dispersion using FFTs: `cpu_fft = np.fft.fft(cpu_data, axis=1)`; create frequency-dependent phase shifts based on `delays`; apply shifts `cpu_fft *= phase_shifts`; inverse FFT `cpu_dedispersed = np.fft.ifft(cpu_fft, axis=1)`. Time this NumPy version. Repeat the *exact same* calculation steps but using `cp` instead of `np` (e.g., `gpu_data = cp.asarray(cpu_data)`, `gpu_fft = cp.fft.fft(...)`, etc.). Time the CuPy version (including data transfer to/from GPU, use `cp.cuda.Stream.null.synchronize()`).
            *   *Output:* Print CPU execution time and GPU execution time (including transfers). Calculate and print speedup.
            *   *Test:* Verify the `cupy` de-dispersed result (transferred back to CPU using `.get()`) is numerically very close to the `numpy` result. Ensure timings include synchronization.
            *   *Extension:* Vary the size of the input data (N_channels, N_samples) and plot the speedup factor vs data size. Implement the de-dispersion using direct time-domain shifts (more complex but avoids FFTs) and compare performance. Use CuPy streams for potentially overlapping data transfers and computation.
        *   2.  **Cosmology/Simulations: Simple N-body Force Calculation Kernel with Numba**
            *   *Technique Focus:* Writing a custom GPU kernel using `numba.cuda.jit` for a computationally intensive, data-parallel task (pairwise force calculation) (Section 41.5).
            *   *Data Source:* NumPy array of particle positions `pos` (N x 3). Particle masses `mass` (N). Gravitational softening length `eps`.
            *   *Modules Used:* `numba.cuda`, `numpy`, `math`.
            *   *Processing:* Define CUDA kernel `force_kernel(pos, mass, acc_out, N, eps)` decorated with `@cuda.jit`. Inside kernel, determine global thread index `i = cuda.grid(1)`. If `i < N`, loop through `j` from 0 to N-1. If `i != j`, calculate distance vector `dr`, squared distance `dist_sq`, force magnitude `F = G * mass[j] / (dist_sq + eps*eps)`, accumulate acceleration components `acc_x, acc_y, acc_z`. Use `cuda.atomic.add(acc_out, (3*i + 0), acc_x)` etc. to safely accumulate forces (simple but potentially slow due to atomics for this naive implementation). Allocate GPU arrays `d_pos = cuda.to_device(pos)`, `d_mass = cuda.to_device(mass)`, `d_acc = cuda.device_array_like(acc_template)`. Configure blocks/grids. Launch kernel `force_kernel[blockspergrid, threadsperblock](d_pos, d_mass, d_acc, N, eps)`. Copy result back `acc = d_acc.copy_to_host()`.
            *   *Output:* The calculated acceleration array `acc` for all particles, computed on the GPU.
            *   *Test:* Compare the GPU-calculated acceleration for a few particles with a direct serial calculation in NumPy/Python for a small N. Check for correctness.
            *   *Extension:* Implement a more efficient parallel reduction strategy within the kernel instead of using atomics for force accumulation. Compare performance against a CPU implementation (serial and potentially using `numba.prange` for parallel CPU). Use shared memory within the kernel for optimization (advanced).

            *   *Technique Focus:* Using `mpi4py` and `h5py` (compiled with parallel support) to write different parts of a large dataset from multiple processes into a single HDF5 file concurrently (Sections 42.3, 42.4).
            *   *Data Source:* Large NumPy arrays representing simulation state (e.g., particle positions, velocities) distributed across MPI ranks (e.g., each rank holds N/size particles).
            *   *Modules Used:* `h5py`, `mpi4py.MPI`, `numpy`. (Requires parallel `h5py` installation).
            *   *Processing:* Get `comm`, `rank`, `size`. Each rank has its local data `local_pos`, `local_vel`. Calculate offset `start = rank * local_N`, `end = start + local_N`. Open HDF5 file `f = h5py.File('checkpoint.hdf5', 'w', driver='mpio', comm=comm)`. Collectively create datasets `dset_pos = f.create_dataset('position', (total_N, 3), dtype='f8')`. Each process writes its local data to the correct slice: `dset_pos[start:end, :] = local_pos`. Repeat for velocity. Close file `f.close()`.
            *   *Output:* A single HDF5 file `checkpoint.hdf5` containing the combined data written by all processes. Confirmation message from each rank upon write completion.
            *   *Test:* Run the script with multiple MPI processes. After execution, use `h5dump checkpoint.hdf5` or load the file serially in Python to verify the datasets have the correct total size and contain data (check slices corresponding to different ranks).
            *   *Extension:* Add attributes to the HDF5 file (e.g., simulation time, number of particles) – attributes should typically be written only by rank 0 after opening the file. Use collective I/O mode (`with dset.collective:` block) for potentially better performance on some systems, especially for contiguous writes. Add compression to the datasets (`f.create_dataset(..., compression='gzip')`) and compare file size and write time.
        *   2.  **Large Survey Analysis: Parallel Reading of Data Subsets from HDF5**
            *   *Technique Focus:* Using `mpi4py` and parallel `h5py` for parallel reading of different slices of a large dataset by multiple processes (Sections 42.3, 42.4).
            *   *Data Source:* A single, large HDF5 file (`survey_catalog.hdf5`) containing a multi-column dataset (e.g., `/data/photometry`, size TotalRows x N_bands), stored on a parallel file system.
            *   *Modules Used:* `h5py`, `mpi4py.MPI`, `numpy`. (Requires parallel `h5py`).
            *   *Processing:* Get `comm`, `rank`, `size`. Calculate row slice for each rank: `rows_per_rank = TotalRows // size`, `start = rank * rows_per_rank`, `end = (rank + 1) * rows_per_rank` (handle remainder). Open HDF5 file `f = h5py.File('survey_catalog.hdf5', 'r', driver='mpio', comm=comm)`. Access dataset `dset = f['/data/photometry']`. Each rank reads its slice: `local_data = dset[start:end, :]`. Each rank performs local analysis (e.g., `local_mean = np.mean(local_data[:, 0])` for first band). Print rank and local mean.
            *   *Output:* Each MPI process prints its rank and the mean value calculated from its assigned chunk of data.
            *   *Test:* Verify that each rank reads a unique slice (check `start`/`end` values). Check if the local means seem reasonable. For small test file, compare results to serial calculation.
            *   *Extension:* Use `comm.reduce` to calculate the global mean across all processes from the `local_mean` values (remembering to weight by `local_N` if chunks are uneven). Read non-contiguous data based on some selection criteria (more complex, might require multiple reads or reading larger chunks and filtering locally). Compare performance of independent vs collective reading modes.
